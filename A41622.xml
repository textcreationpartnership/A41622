         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Offer not the following Collection, as any thing new; it has a much better commendation from the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Contents, which being a part of the Sacred Text, ſtands in need of no other Title, from which to raiſe its va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue. It is the word of God; that is enough. And as far as it contains this. I can boldly recommend it, I preſs, I importune all, who have a true Faith in Chriſt, to the Reading and Study of it; becauſe it is that, which the Spirit of God ſpeaks to Man, and Man can have no hopes of Life Eternal, but by hearing and following this Word of Life. But are not all provided with this, in a more Authentic Form in their Bibles, which they have by them? It
<pb facs="tcp:34034:3"/> is true; but while all are thus provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and generally well-read in this Sacred volume; yet when I look upon the Method of the Chriſtian World, and conſider the common Practice of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, I ſee ſuch a <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from what the Word of God teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, that I cannot but fear, they either are not ſerious in what they profeſs, or do not take it for their Rule, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve not what it enjoyns, or at leaſt do not remember what belongs to them.</p>
            <p>This fear (which I could wiſh, it were not ſo reaſonable as it ſeems to me) has prevailed on me to lay this ſhort Collection before them, wherein I not only put them in mind of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel being their Rule, and of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of obſerving it; but likewiſe, by reducing the Texts under particular Heads, have provided againſt all the Objections of Giddy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nthinking Tempers, of Sloth and Ill Memory, in the opportunity of ſeeing at one glance, the Principal Directions which the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel gives them, according to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Duties and different Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb facs="tcp:34034:3"/> of Life. And tho' ſomething of this has been already done by another hand; yet obſerving ſtill ſuch a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral corruption among Chriſtians, that they as boldly live on in the practice of what the Goſpel condemns, as if they knew of no ſuch Rule, I cannot but think there's Reaſon enough for this Repetition, in again laying their Rule before them, and putting them in mind of the neceſſity of their making it a Practical Rule to them.</p>
            <p>It is a reveal'd Truth, That there is no Salvation but thro' Chriſt; and it is another Truth upon the ſame Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, That there can be no Hope thro' Chriſt, but by keeping his Words and obſerving his Law. His Words and his Law are the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt; the Goſpel then muſt be the Rule to all thoſe who hope in Chriſt; and ſuch as follow it not, obſerve not the condition he has propos'd for having a part in his Promiſes. Is this true? Then what an unhappy World, what a wretched Age are we in, where the Goſpel is ſo far from being the Rule, even to thoſe that believe it; that it is
<pb facs="tcp:34034:4"/> as generally tranſgreſſed or neglected, as if there was no dependance on it: Where what it ſtrictly commands, is no more regarded, and what it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns, no more avoided, than if its Doctrine was fabulous, its Heaven was a Fiction, and its Hell no more than a Dream? Is not this true in all the ways of Pride, Intemperance, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality, Covetouſneſs, Love of the World and our ſelves? Is not this true in all kinds of Frauds, Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaching, Injuſtice, Animoſities, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, Diſſention, Malice? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Is not this too generally true in all that belongs to Eating, Drinking, Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Converſing? Have not all, in theſe Particulars, departed from their Rule? Are not theſe Evils as induſtriouſly promoted and encouraged among Chriſtians, as by any unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nation whatever? What People in the World are more Vain, Proud, Fraudulent, Malicious, and greater Lovers of themſelves than they? Where do's it appear, that Humility, Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Meekneſs, Self-denial, Moderation and Forſaking the World, are the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb facs="tcp:34034:4"/> Law, and the conditions for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining everlaſting Hapineſs? Who can ſay in theſe and infinite other Points, that Chriſtian Practice has any regard to the Goſpel? And yet at the ſame time our common Profeſſion is, That the Goſpel is our Rule, it teaches the way of Life, and we can have no hopes of Life, but by doing what it teaches.</p>
            <p>And have not Chriſtians then great reaſon, with their moſt ſerious applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to ſtudy this Rule, and ſee what it recommends as neceſſary, and what it diſapproves, that ſo they may no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger be falſe to their Profeſſion, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from the Goſpel, which they acknowledge to be the Guide to Bliſs; that they may walk in all the ways of the Lord, keep his Ordinances and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his Statutes, that they may have no confidence or peace, but in ſuch Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices only as are approved by the Word, and therefore moſt agreeable to the Will of God? This is certainly, as a general<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo the greateſt intereſt of all, and ought therefore to be their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal buſineſs. For clearneſs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition
<pb facs="tcp:34034:5"/> I offer this ſummary of Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Rules; which being ranked under ſeveral Heads, may be eaſily conſulted by all Capacities, and will poſſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare to them, what is the Will of God, and in all circumſtances of Life diſcover how far the Goſpel approves or diſapproves. This can be the only ſure way of ſtanding againſt ill Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, and not being carried away by the authority and number of offenders, nor letting the World take place, where God only ought to be heard. If there appears any thing difficult in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Rules, I am not to anſwer for that; I propoſe the Goſpel, as I find it; and having put all Chriſtians in mind, that this is the Rule which they profeſs, I here with all Charity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure them not to deſpiſe it, but to take their Directions from thence of all that is Lawful, Juſt, Holy, and Well-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God; for if the Goſpel be Life to thoſe, that follow it, it muſt be their Condemnation, who obſerve it not.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> WHAT is a Chriſtian?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> A Chriſtian is one, that believes in Chriſt, and profeſſes to live according to the Doctrin of the Goſpel.</p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:34034:6"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What then is the general Duty of a Chriſtian?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To do what he profeſſes; that is, to conſider in every thing that the Goſpel is his Rule; to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min diligently, what it teaches, and make it the general Endeavor of his whole Life, to do in all things, as this directs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is this a ſtrict Obligation upon all, or may it be omitted without a Fault?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is ſuch an Obligation, that it cannot be omitted wilfully, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sin; and to live in the general Neglect of it, is to be out of the way of Salvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why ſo?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe the Goſpel is the new Law, which Chriſt has left for all to keep, that believe in him; and to neglect this, is to neglect Chriſt; to deſpiſe it, is to deſpiſe him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> And is there not Salvation for ſuch, as do thus?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They are certainly out of the way of Salvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How ſo?</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:34034:6"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe Chriſt is the <hi>only Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator</hi> of the new Teſtament, thro' whom alone we can hope for Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and how then can they be in the way of Salvation, who live in the Neglect and Contempt of him? <hi>2dly,</hi> Chriſt is the <hi>Light of the World,</hi> and by his Goſpel he communicates his Light to Men; they then, who neglect and deſpiſe this Light, walk in Darkneſs, and this Darkneſs can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lead to Life everlaſting. <hi>3dly,</hi> Chriſt is <hi>the Way, the Truth and the Life;</hi> and in his Goſpel is manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Way, this Truth and this Life; they then, who neglect and deſpiſe the Doctrin of the Goſpel, cannot be in the way; they follow a Lie, inſtead of Truth, and muſt meet with Death, inſtead of Life. <hi>4thly,</hi> It is by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Chriſt every one muſt live, that belongs to Chriſt, and expects everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Happineſs; and without this Spirit, all Hopes are vain; <hi>If any Man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his,</hi> Rom. 8. 9.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:34034:7"/> 
                  <hi>He that ſaith, he abideth in him, ought himſelf alſo to walk, even as he walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 6. Now if this Spirit of Chriſt be neceſſary; how can they be ſuppos'd to have it, who walk not by the Goſpel, in which this Spirit is taught; but by deſpiſing or neglecting it, give Demonſtration of the Spirit of Chriſt being not in them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What does this prove?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It proves, that no Salvation can be expected, but thro' Chriſt; that none can have a part in Chriſt, but ſuch only, as obſerve his Law; that his Law being deliver'd in the Goſpel, there can be no Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but for thoſe, who ſincerely make it their Endeavor to live, as Chriſt has preſcrib'd in the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Then the Goſpel muſt be obſerv'd; but what is it to obſerve or follow the Goſpel?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is to make the Goſpel our Rule, for diſcerning the Will of God, and knowing what is pleaſing or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to him. It is to take Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from that, What we are to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:34034:7"/> deſire, and what to fear; what we are to value, and what to deſpiſe. It is to conſult that, in all we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe or do. It is to take from thence the Determination, of Right and Wrong; of what we are carefully to perform, or with Solicitude to avoid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Then they, who do not thus, do not follow the Goſpel?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No, they do not: They may have a Faith in what the Goſpel teaches; but if they do not the Works of the Goſpel, their Faith is dead, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 26. It is ſuch Faith as is in Hell, and even the Devils have, <hi>Ib. v.</hi> 19. Theſe may know the Will of God; but they do it not; theſe may honor God with their Lips; but their Heart is far from him: And what will this avail; or how is this following the Goſpel, when the Goſpel teaches, That the Servant who knows his Lord's Will, and does it not, <hi>ſhall be beaten with many Stripes,</hi> Luke 12. 47. And <hi>not every one that ſaith unto me, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:34034:8"/> 
                  <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven; but he, that doth the Will of my Father, who is in Heaven,</hi> Mat. 7. 21?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Then there is to be no Confidence of Salvation, upon a Faith in Chriſt only, or in being a Member of his Church?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Faith is neceſſary to Salvation; for <hi>without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> Heb. 11. 6. But a Faith in what God teaches, without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Will of God, can never bring any to the Poſſeſſion of God. Bliſs is promis'd to ſuch only, as <hi>Hear the Word of God, and keep it,</hi> Luke 11. 28. It is not enough therefore to be call'd by Faith; for <hi>many are call'd, but few choſen,</hi> Matth. 20. 16. It is not enough to be planted in Chriſt's Vineyard: For <hi>every Tree, that brings not forth good Fruit, is cut down, and caſt into the Fire,</hi> Mat. 7. 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Then you think, many of thoſe, who have a Faith in Chriſt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all that he teaches, are loſt eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> As many of theſe, as do not the Will of God, in following the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:34034:8"/> Goſpel, but depart from it, and live in a general Diſobedience to his Law. Such as theſe muſt expect no Favor in Conſideration of their Faith; but rather a deeper Damnation for their Ingratitude and Abuſe of God's Bleſſings, for knowing (thro' Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy) the Will of God, and not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What now is this Chapter in ſhort?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That the only Means of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, is to <hi>Believe</hi> and <hi>Do,</hi> as Chriſt teaches in his holy Goſpel. All his Diſciples are to hear him, <hi>Ipſum au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite, Hear ye him;</hi> as the Voice from Heaven publiſh'd it on the Mount, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 5. All of his Flock hear his Voice; <hi>My ſheep hear my Voice, and follow me,</hi> Jo. 10. 27. As many, as do thus, are in the way to Salvation, having Chriſt their Teacher, and the Shepherd of their Souls. And they, who do not thus, cannot have their hopes in him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> MAY we not follow our own Inclinations?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Chriſt is to be the Chriſtian's Rule; if then our Inclinations are according to what Chriſt teaches, we may ſafely follow them; but if they are contrary to what Chriſt teaches, then to follow them, is to forſake our Rule, who is Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> And what are our natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They ariſe from a corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and therefore are generally cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt; they are the Effect of Sin, and therefore are generally either ſinful, or leading to Sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Then a Chriſtian is not to follow them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No; he is to be ſo far from following, that it muſt be his daily Care to ſtand againſt them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why ſo?</p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:34034:9"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe being corrupt and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, if they are not reſiſted, they draw Perſons from Chriſt, and that is to forſake their Rule.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is it the evident Duty of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to ſtand againſt theſe Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is; for ſo Chriſt himſelf teaches, in requiring Self-denial, as a neceſſary Condition for becoming his Diſciple: <hi>If any Man will come after me, let him deny himſelf,</hi> Luk. 9. 23.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is not this preſs'd more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in holy Scripture?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes; by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſtiling theſe Inclinations, the <hi>Old Man, Concupiſcence,</hi> the <hi>Carnal Man,</hi> the <hi>Deſires of the Fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. poſitively declares the neceſſity of reſiſting them, and that, otherwiſe, it is not poſſible to pleaſe God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> As where?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Put off the old man, which is corrupt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 22. We are debtors, not to the Fleſh, to live after the Fleſh; for if ye live after the Fleſh, ye ſhall die: But if you, thro' the Spirit, do mortifie the deeds of the Body, ye ſhall
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:34034:10"/> live, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 12, 13. To be carnal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minded is Death; becauſe the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Man is Enmity againſt God, <hi>ib. v.</hi> 6, 7. The Fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the Fleſh; and theſe are contrary to one another.—They that are Chriſt's, have crucified the Fleſh, with the Affections and Luſts, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17, 24. With the mind, I my ſelf ſerve the Law of God; but with the Fleſh, the Law of Sin. But I keep under my Body, and bring it into Subjection, leſt that by any means, when I have preached to others, I my ſelf ſhould be a caſt-away, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 27.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What does all this ſhew?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It ſhews, that thro' the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our Nature, we have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Inclinations, which are contrary to the Law of God; that if we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them, they lead to Death; that therefore every one, who profeſſes himſelf a Follower of Chriſt and his Goſpel, is abſolutely oblig'd to ſtand againſt them; to mortifie, crucifie, and bring them into Subjection; for that otherwiſe he cannot be a Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:34034:10"/> of Chriſt. Chriſtians then, whoſe Profeſſion it is, to make Chriſt their Rule, muſt not indulge their natural Inclinations, much leſs, make them their Rule.</p>

               <head>CHAP III. Of the World.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> MAY it be allow'd a Chriſtian to follow the World?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Ways of the World are ſo generally contrary to the Goſpel, that a Chriſtian muſt forget his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, if he follows the World; if taking that for his Rule, he walks in the Ways of the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What do you mean here by the World?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I mean the Lovers of the World, and their general Practice of ſeeking to pleaſe themſelves and the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why does this lye under ſuch an ill name with you?</p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:34034:11"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe in this Practice there is no regard had to the Goſpel; but the great buſineſs is to comply with that Corruption, which Man brings with him into the World; it is all in Favour of Vanity, Ambition, Sloth, Idleneſs, Intemperance, Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality, Concupiſcence, Covetouſneſs, Envy, Paſſion, Revenge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And theſe being the very Evils, which the Chriſtian is ſtrictly oblig'd, by the Goſpel, to overcome, how can the World have a better Name with him, which by many arguments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends theſe, as the only things, that are to be valued, as the only Satisfactions and Comforts of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> If this be ſo, it muſt be confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that it is not a Chriſtian's Part to Follow the World. But what if ſome are not willing to believe ſo ill of the World, as this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> If they are not willing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it; let them but open their Eyes, and they cannot help ſeeing it. The World indeed endeavors to conceal ſome ſcandalous Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:34034:11"/> but as for all theſe, it Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly owns them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But the Goſpel being the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an's Rule, would it not make a more convincing Impreſſion, if this would give him the Character of the World? And then too, thoſe would be left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuſe, whoſe Paſſion makes them unwilling to believe it.</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Nothing is more fully deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Scripture than this. Hear what Chriſts ſays of the World;</hi> Me it ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, becauſe I teſtifie of it, that the works thereof are evil, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 7. The Spirit of Truth, whom the World can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not receive, becauſe it ſeeth him not, neither knoweth him, <hi>Jo.</hi> 14. 17. I have manifeſted thy Name unto the Men, which thou gaveſt me out of the World.—I pray not for the World, but for them, which thou haſt given me, for they are thine, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 6, 9. I have given them <hi>(the Apoſtles)</hi> thy word; and the World hath hated them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not of the World, even as I am not of the World, <hi>Ib. v.</hi> 14. If the World hate you, ye know that it hated me, before it hated you. If ye
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:34034:12"/> were of the World, the World would love his own: But becauſe ye are not of the World, but I have choſen you out of the World, therefore the World hateth you, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 18, 19. <hi>Here you ſee Chriſt declares the works of the World to be evil; that the World knows not the Spirit of Truth: That thoſe, whom Chriſt has cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, are not the World; that He himſelf is not of the World; that the World hates both them and him; and is not this enough to convince any one, who believes in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, that the World is not to be followed; ſince he here ſhews, that ſuch</hi> as God has choſen, <hi>and thoſe</hi> who are of the World, <hi>are like</hi> Two extreams contrary to one another; <hi>ſo that they, who are of the</hi> One, <hi>do not belong to the</hi> Other?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Does the Scripture ſpeak farther upon this Subject.</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Yes, the Apoſtles preach the ſame Doctrin with their Maſter: Hear what they ſay:</hi> Be not conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this World; but be ye tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the renewing of your mind,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:34034:12"/> 
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 2. Chriſt, who gave himſelf for our Sins, that he might deliver us from this preſent Evil world, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Will of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 4. Know ye not, that the friendſhip of the World is enmity with God? Whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver therefore will be a Friend of the World, is the Enemy of God, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 4. The whole World lyeth in Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 19. Love not the World, neither the things, that are in the World. If any man love the World, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the World, the luſt of the Fleſh, and the luſt of the Eyes, and the pride of Life, is not of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but is of the World, 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 2. 15, 16. Whatſoever is born of God, overcometh the World, 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 5. 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Add no more; for this muſt be own'd Evident from Scripture, that the World is contrary to God, and that whoever loves the World and its ways, in this gives demonſtration of the Love of God being not in him. But tell me now; how muſt all this be applied, that has been hitherto ſaid in this and the foregoing Chapters?</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. Application of the Foregoing Chapters.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> THE Application of what has been hitherto ſaid, is very Plain. For if it be the Eſſential or Neceſſary part of a Chriſtian, to Believe in and Follow Chriſt; then he muſt not Follow that which is contrary to Chriſt. And it being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident from the Goſpel it ſelf, that both our <hi>Natural Inclinations</hi> and the <hi>World</hi> are contrary to Chriſt; hence it becomes certain, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever deſigns in earneſt to be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, as he Profeſſes, muſt neither follow his own Natural Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor the World; and whoever follows them, is ſo far falſe to his Profeſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> I ſee the neceſſity of owning this; but what a ſtrange Chriſtian World then is ours, which Profeſſing Chriſt and a zeal for the Truth of his Goſpel, ſo as even to devour one another, upon
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:34034:13"/> the account of its Speculative Doctrines; do yet all ſo generally agree in forſaking the Practice of it, as if they had no Faith in Chriſt or his Goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> There is too much ground for your ſurprize: For certainly, whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver looks upon the general Practice of Chriſtians, will have much ado to diſtinguiſh them from Heathens; ſince they are as ſtrongly bent upon following their own Inclinations and the World, as if they had no cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt them, nor any Law to forbid them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Inſtead of enlarging Complaints, rather tell me, what a Chriſtian is to do, that deſires in earneſt to ſatisfie the Duties of his Profeſſion, and have no part in this general Corruption?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I have already told you: He muſt follow the Goſpel, which is the Rule, Chriſt has given him; he muſt ſtudy what the Spirit of the Goſpel is, and with all ſolicitude en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to live according to this Spirit. Whatever is there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, he muſt obſerve: Whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is there forbid, he muſt avoid:
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:34034:14"/> Whatever is there approv'd, he muſt approve: Whatever is there declar'd the Character of things, whether as Good or Evil, as Honourable or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable, as Edifying or Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, as Profitable or Dangerous, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he muſt eſteem them, and hence taking the true Meaſures of all things, by theſe Meaſures he muſt govern his Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But if <hi>Inclination</hi> or the <hi>World</hi> put in their Plea, and give very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent notions of things, from what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in the Goſpel?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> As often as they do ſo, they are not to be Regarded, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd much leſs Followed. The Chriſtian is to be True to his Profeſſion; and all ſuch Suggeſtions are to be look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as Trials of his Fidelity, and as Temptations, which he is bound to reſiſt. And this he muſt do with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But if <hi>Cuſtom</hi> and <hi>Example</hi> be pleaded?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> If they be; What Authority can there be in theſe againſt the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt Will of God? Theſe cannot
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:34034:14"/> make void what God has ſaid, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuate his Law. Let the Goſpel then be conſulted, and as this deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines, ſo it muſt ſtand good, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, that appears againſt it. If we could ſuppoſe it to be an Angel from Heaven, yet in this caſe, he is not to be regarded; how much leſs therefore the Cuſtom or Example of Weak and Sinful Men?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> If <hi>Company</hi> undertakes to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Whatever Power there be in this; yet no Chriſtian can think it reaſonable, to hearken to Man, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than God. In a Caſe, where God has ſpoke, there can be no Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to Man. All ſuch Perſwaſions therefore, as far as they are diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Goſpel, are to be look'd upon as Snares, ſuch as the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an is bound with all Diligence to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Then you will allow of nothing to prevail in this Caſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No, of nothing: There is no Authority here in Number; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Learning, Exemplarity
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:34034:15"/> or Piety can authorize nothing, which the Goſpel condemns or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves. All muſt ſtand, as it is there delivered, and to ſet up for other Notions, is to attempt againſt God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> And now for the Practice of this Doctrine, how muſt this be?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> For Practice, a Chriſtian muſt ſeriouſly examin all the General Concerns of Human Life, and having diſcover'd how far the Goſpel en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages or allows in each, and how far it diſapproves, he muſt take this for his Standard, and endeavour to come as near it, as he can, without taking notice of whatever is plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>World</hi> or <hi>Inclination</hi> to the contrary. A Life thus regulated will certainly be a Chriſtian Life, ſuch as I heartily recommend, and will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly at our Dying hour be the greateſt of all Comforts. But now to offer ſome help in it, I muſt make an Eſſay of bringing all things to the Ballance, and ſeeing how they weigh by the Weights of the Sanctuary; ſo to diſcover, how far the Chriſtian walks by this Rule, and in what Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars departs from it.</p>

                  <hi>3dly,</hi> In S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtle: Where he gives in this Advice; <hi>We brought nothing with us into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out: Having food and raiment, let us be therewith content,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 7, 8. <hi>I will therefore—that women adorn themſelves in Modeſt Apparel, with ſhamefac'dneſs and ſobriety: Not with broider'd hair, or gold, or pearls, or coſtly Array; but (which becometh women profeſſing Godlineſs) with good works,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 9, 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>4thly,</hi> In the charge given by S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to Wives; <hi>Whoſe adorning,</hi> ſays he, <hi>let it not be that outward adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of Gold, or of putting on of Apparel: but let it the hidden man of the heart, in that, which is not corruptible, even the Ornament of a meek and quiet Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 3, 4.</p>
               <p>Here you ſee, in a few words, what the Goſpel approves, and what
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:34034:16"/> it diſapproves in this Point; ſo that whatever conſtructions are put upon the Words, yet ſtill it is evident, what method they are to follow, who reſolve, that, not the World, but the Goſpel ſhall be their Rule.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> This muſt be confeſs'd even by the World and Vanity it ſelf, tho' they cannot follow it. But is there any thing more upon this Subject?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The ſame may be ſtill farther preſs'd from other Heads; as,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Vanity, Pride, Ambition and Envy, are contrary to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; therefore ſuch Chriſtians, as deſire to live by the Goſpel, muſt not permit theſe to have any part in buying their Cloaths, or putting them on; but, inſtead of Following, muſt not Follow what theſe ſuggeſt; and ſuch as do otherwiſe, have not the Goſpel for their Rule.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> All, that falls under the Heads of Exceſs, Immoderateneſs, Prodigality or Waſting what ſhould be the Proviſion of Family, is repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Goſpel: Therefore all ſuch expenſive Cloathing, as falls
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:34034:17"/> under any of theſe Heads, is depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Spirit of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Goſpel preſcribes <hi>ſeeking Firſt the Kingdom of God, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming the time, Giving alms, not Seeking to pleaſe the World:</hi> Therefore all that muſt be condemn'd as diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Goſpel, where the ſolicitude is greater for complying with a vain World, or a vain Humor, than for ſeeking Heaven; where the Time and Money, which are Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings given for better uſes, are wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in ſetting forth a rotten and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Carcaſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Juſtice is abſolutely requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Goſpel; therefore all that Care, Solicitude and Expence, muſt be contrary to the Goſpel, which is in the ſervice of Injuſtice. And is not all that ſo, which is applied to the Gratifying, Flattering and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting the Body, which for its Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs and manifold Sins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, deſerves nothing but Contempt and Puniſhment?</p>
               <p>Here now having Conſider'd all, that belongs to Cloathing, by the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:34034:17"/> Goſpel, you ſee, what is approv'd, and what is diſapprov'd. Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for neceſſity is approv'd; coarſe Apparel is commended in the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt; a Modeſt Dreſs is recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to Women, accompanied with Shamefacedneſs, Sobriety, and a Meek Spirit: Outward Adorning with Gold, Pearls or Coſtly Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel is reprov'd; Inward Adorning with Virtue is requir'd. All that is ſuggeſted, in Dreſſing, by Vanity, Pride, Envy, or for pleaſing the World, is forbid. All that is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate, whether as to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of Time or Money, is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd. In this, it is very eaſie to diſcern, what is the Spirit of the Goſpel: And if it be diſcern'd, then all thoſe, who deſire in Truth to be the Followers of Chriſt, know what they are to do. They muſt approve only that, which their Rule ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves; and as for all, whatever In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination or the World recommends beyond that, they muſt ſhut their hearts againſt it, and ſay; the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is our Rule, and this only we muſt follow.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> WHAT direction do's the Goſpel give as to Eating and Drinking?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>There is enough mention'd, to ſerve for a Chriſtian's Rule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Gluttony and Drunkenneſs are poſitively Forbid;</hi> Take heed to your ſelves, leſt at any time your hearts be overcharged with Surfeiting and Drunkenneſs, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21. 34. Let us walk honeſtly, as in the day; not in Riot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Drunkenneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 13. Wo unto you, that are full; for ye ſhall hunger, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 25. Drunkards ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 10. The Works of the Fleſh are manifeſt—Drunkenneſs—Revel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings—of the which I tell you, that they, which do ſuch things, ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 19, 21. Be not Drunk with wine, wherein is exceſs; but be fill'd with the Spirit, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 18.</p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:34034:18"/>
               <p> Secondly, <hi>It is particularly obſerv'd in the Rich Glutton, that he</hi> Fared ſumptuouſly every day, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 19. It is a good thing, that the heart be eſtabliſh'd with Grace, not with Meats, which have not profitted them, that have been occupied therein, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 9. The Kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteouſneſs and peace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 17. Many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the Croſs of Chriſt; whoſe end is deſtruction, whoſe God is their Belly, and whoſe Glory is their Shame, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 18, 19.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Temperance and Sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are recommended;</hi> Teaching us, that denying ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and godly in this preſent world, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 12. Wherefore gird up your loins, be ſober, and hope to the end, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 13. Be ſober, be vigilant, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8. Let your Moderation be known to all men, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 5. He ſhall be great in the ſight of the Lord, and ſhall drink neither wine nor ſtrong
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:34034:19"/> drink, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 15. His Meat was Locuſts and wild Honey, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 4. Let us not ſleep, as do others; but let us watch, and be ſober. Let us, who are of the day, be ſober, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 6, 8. Whether ye eat or drink, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ye do, do all to the Glory of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 31. Having Food and Raiment, let us be therewith content, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 8.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Faſting is commanded: Jeſus</hi> Faſted Forty Days and Forty Nights, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>Anna</hi> departed not from the Temple, but ſerved God with Faſtings and Prayer, Night and Day, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 37. This kind <hi>(of Devil)</hi> can come forth by nothing but by Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Faſting, <hi>Mar.</hi> 19. 29. The Days will come, when the Bridegroom ſhall be taken away from them, and then ſhall they faſt in thoſe Days, <hi>Luk.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. 35. They adminiſtred to the Lord, and faſted. And when they had faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and pray'd, and laid their Hands on them, they ſent them away, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 2, 3. When they had ordain'd them Elders in every Church, and had prayed with faſting, they commended them to the Lord, <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 23.</p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:34034:19"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>In this may be diſcern'd the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Goſpel in this Point; that while it approves Eating and Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Support of Nature, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, that this be done Soberly, and with Moderation, and to the Glory of God. It commends Abſtinence and Faſting. It reproves Faring Sumptuouſly. It condemns the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude of pleaſing the Appetite, and making the Belly a God. It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares Surfeiting, Rioting, Revelling and Drunkenneſs, to be ſuch Crimes, that their Guilt excludes from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If theſe be the Dictates of the Chriſtian's Rule, then it is very eaſie to obſerve, how far the Goſpel al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, as to Eating and Drinking, and how far it diſapproves. And hence it is obvious, what they are to do, who follow the Goſpel. They are to think nothing allowable, but as it is here approv'd; and muſt not, by deceitful Conſtructions, pretend to juſtifie that, which is here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd. Eſpecially where the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is ſo poſitive, and the Guilt</hi>

                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:34034:20"/> ſhall live. For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 13, 14. Put off con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the former Converſation, the old Man, which is corrupt, according to the deceitful Luſts, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 22. I beſeech you, as Strangers and Pilgrims; abſtain from fleſhly Luſts, which war againſt the Soul, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 11. If any Man will come after me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs, and follow me. For whoſoever will ſave his Life, ſhall loſe it; and whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will loſe his Life, for my ſake, ſhall find it. For what is a Man profitted, if he ſhall gain the whole world, and loſe his own Soul? Or what ſhall a Man give in Exchange for his Soul? <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 24, 25, 26. He that loveth his Life, ſhall loſe it: and he, that hateth his Life in this World, ſhall keep it unto Life eternal. If any Man ſerve me, let him follow me, <hi>Jo.</hi> 12. 25, 26.</p>
               <p>By this ſhall all Men know, that ye are my Diſciples, if ye have love one to another, <hi>Jo.</hi> 13. 35. I ſay unto you, love your Enemies, bleſs them,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:34034:20"/> that curſe you, do good to them, that hate you, and pray for them, which deſpitely uſe you, and perſecute you, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 44. Love not the world, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the things, that are in the world, 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 2. 15. Put on (as the elect of God holy and beloved) Bowels of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, Kindneſſes, Humbleneſs of mind, Meekneſs, Long-ſuffering; Forbearing one another, and Forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel againſt any; even as Chriſt forgave you, ſo alſo do ye. And above all things put on Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which is the bond of perfectneſs; and let the peace of God rule in your hearts: And be ye thankful. Let the Word of Chriſt dwell in you richly in all Wiſdom; and whatever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jeſus, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. What things were gain to me, thoſe I counted loſs for Chriſt: Yea doubtleſs, and I do count all things but loſs, for the excellency of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord: For whom I have ſuffered the loſs of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Chriſt, and be found
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:34034:21"/> in him, not having mine own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, which is of the law, but that, which is thro' the Faith of Chriſt, the righteouſneſs, which is of God by Faith; that I may know him, and the power of his Reſurrection, and the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of his Sufferings, being made conformable unto his death, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 7. Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt? Shall tribulation or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs—? I am perſwaded, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther death, nor life,—nor any other creature, ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 35, 38. For me to live is Chriſt, and to die is gain, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 21. I have learned, in whatever ſtate I am, therewith to be content, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 11. Seek thoſe things, which are above, where Chriſt ſitteth on the right hand of God. Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth: For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Chriſt in God, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theſe are ſome, amongſt infinite other Directions, which the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel gives for regulating of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:34034:21"/> 
                  <hi>Man. Were they preſcribed to the Apoſtles only, or to ſome Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Perſons or States, there might be a juſt excuſe for ſuch as obſerve them not; but being writ to the Faithful of all States and Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they are to be obſerv'd by all, that believe in Chriſt: And in this may Chriſtians make the trueſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſtate of their Souls. For if this be preſcrib'd to all, all are bound to labor, in bringing their Souls to this happy diſpoſition; and they, who are not ſolicitous in this, whatever their Faith be, have not the Spirit of a true Diſciple.</hi>

               <p>A. <hi>Such as are very particular and ſtrict in the Charge. Hear ſome of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:34034:22"/>
               <p> Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart—Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbor, as thy ſelf. On theſe two Commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 37, 39, 40. A new Commandment, I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye alſo love one another. By this ſhall all men know, that ye are my Diſciples, if ye have love one to another, <hi>Jo.</hi> 13. 34, 35. Theſe things I command you, that ye love one another, <hi>Jo.</hi> 15. 17. This is my commandment; that ye love one another, as I have loved you. Ye are my Friends, if ye do whatſoever I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you, <hi>Jo.</hi> 15. 12, 14. Let love be without diſſimulation. Be kindly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectioned one to another, with brotherly love, in honor preferring one another, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 9, 10. By love ſerve one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; for all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbor as thy ſelf. But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed, that ye be not conſum'd one of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 13, 14, 15. Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: For he that loveth another hath fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:34034:22"/> the Law. For this, thou ſhalt not commit adultery, Thou ſhalt not kill, Thou ſhall not ſteal, Thou ſhalt not bear falſe witneſs, Thou ſhalt not covet, and if there be any other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, it is briefly comprehended in this ſaying, namely, Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbor as thy ſelf. Love work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no ill to his Neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 8, 9, 10. As touching brotherly love, ye need not that I write unto you; for ye your ſelves are taught of God, to love one another. And indeed ye do it towards all the brethren, which are in <hi>Macedonia:</hi> But we beſeech you, brethren, that ye increaſe more and more; and that ye ſtudy to be quiet, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 9, 10, 11. Above all things have fervent Charity among your ſelves: For Charity ſhall cover the multitude of ſins, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 8. He that loveth his brother, abideth in the light, and there is none occaſion of ſtumbling in him. But he that hateth his brother, is in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and walketh in darkneſs, 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 2. 10. Whoſoever doth not righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is not of God, neither he, that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:34034:23"/> loveth not his brother, 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 3. 10. We know, that we have paſſed from death unto life, becauſe we love the brethren; he that loveth not his brother abideth in death. Whoſoever hateth his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is a murtherer; and ye know, that no murtherer hath eternal life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding in him, 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 3. 14, 15. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us. If a man ſay, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar. This Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment have we from him, that he, who loveth God, love his brother alſo, 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 4. 12, 20, 21. Tho' I have the gift of Prophecy, and underſtand all Myſteries, and all Knowledge; and tho' I have all Faith, ſo that I could remove Mountains, and have no Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I am nothing. And tho' I beſtow all my goods to feed the Poor, and tho' I give my Body to be burned, and have not Charity, it profitteth me no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Charity ſuffereth long, and is kind; Charity envieth not; Charity vaunteth not it ſelf, is not puffed up, doth not behave it ſelf unſeemly, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not her own, is not eaſily provoked,

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus the Chriſtian's Rule directs as to this Point. Whoever expects Salvation thro' Chriſt, muſt hear his Word, and make it his daily buſineſs to obſerve it.

               </p>
               <p>I ſay unto you, Love your Enemies, bleſs them, that curſe you, do good to them, that hate you, and pray for them, which deſpitefully uſe you, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute

And unto him, that ſmiteth thee on the one cheek, offer alſo the other; and him that taketh away thy cloak, forbid not to take thy coat alſo. As you would that men ſhould do to you, do ye alſo to them likewiſe. For if ye love them, which love you, what thank have ye? For Sinners alſo love thoſe, that love them. And if ye do good to them, which do good to you, what thank have ye? For Sinners alſo do even the ſame.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:34034:24"/> And if ye lend to them, of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? For Sinners lend to Sinners, to receive as much again.

Dearly beloved, avenge not your ſelves, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther give place unto wrath; for it is written, Vengeance is mine, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay it, ſaith the Lord. Therefore if thine Enemy hunger, feed him, if he thirſt, give him drink: For in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, thou ſhalt heap coals of fire on his head. Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 19, 20, 21. Bleſs them, which perſecute you; bleſs, and curſe not. Recompence no Man evil for evil, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 14,

               <p>
                  <hi>Here is the Rule, and it muſt be follow'd: To diſpence with it, is to break it; to hearken to Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is to forſake it. The Difficulty of its Practice muſt be own'd, and this more particularly in ſome Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers; but Difficulties muſt not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry us againſt the Commands of God; in our undertaking to ſerve him, there was no Proviſo made for our Eaſe or Inclination; but our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion was Abſolute; how then can we pretend to follow Nature, when God's Will is known to us? If the Lord be our God, it is mockery, if we do not follow him.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XI. Of Forgiving Injuries.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> WHAT Directions do's the Goſpel give, as to Forgiving Injuries?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It ſpeaks plainly to the Point:</hi> Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our Debtors, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 12. Then came Peter to him, and ſaid, Lord, how oft ſhall my Brother ſin againſt me, and I forgive him? Till ſeven times? Jeſus ſaid unto him; I ſay not unto thee, until ſeven times: But until ſeventy times ſeven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 21, 22. Then his Lord ſaid unto him, O thou wicked ſervant, I forgave thee all that debt, becauſe thou deſired'ſt me: Should'ſt not thou alſo have had compaſſion on thy Fellow-ſervant, even as I had pity on thee? And his Lord was wroth, and deliver'd him to the tormenters, till he ſhould pay all that was due unto him. So likewiſe ſhall my heavenly Father do alſo unto you, if ye, from your hearts, forgive
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:34034:26"/> not every one his brother their treſpaſſes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 32, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If thy brother treſpaſs againſt thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him. And if he treſpaſs againſt thee ſeven times in a day, and ſeven times in a day turn again to thee, ſaying, I repent; thou ſhalt forgive him; <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. 3, 4. Let all Bitterneſs, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and evil ſpeaking be put away from you, with all malice: And be ye kind one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, tender-hearted, forgiving one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, even as God, for Chriſt's ſake, hath forgiven you, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 31, 32. Put on therefore (as the Elect of God, holy and beloved) bowels of mercies, kindneſs, humbleneſs of mind, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, long-ſuffering; forbearing one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel againſt any; even as Chriſt forgave you, ſo alſo do ye, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3. 12, 13. For if ye forgive men their treſpaſſes, your heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father will alſo forgive you: But if ye forgive not men their treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, neither will your Father forgive your treſpaſſes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 14. 15. And when ye ſtand praying, Forgive, if ye
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:34034:26"/> have ought againſt any; that your Father alſo, which is in heaven, may forgive you your treſpaſſes. But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father, which is in heaven, forgive your treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <hi>Mar.</hi> 11. 25, 26. Forgive, and ye ſhall be forgiven:—for with the ſame mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that ye mete withal, it ſhall be meaſur'd to you again, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 37. He ſhall have Judgment without mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that hath ſhewed no mercy, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 13. Charity ſuffereth long,—is not eaſily provok'd, thinketh no evil,—beareth all things,—endureth all things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus ſays the Chriſtian's Rule, and there are no Promiſes, but what requireth the Obſervance of it. Let then all degrees of Malice, Revenge, Hatred, Ill-will, Animoſities, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments, Provocations, Grudgings, Want of Neighborly Correſpondence, with all the train of ſuch like Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Diſorders, be examined by the Goſpel; and, upon the evidence of their being not allow'd upon any account, but abſolutely condemn'd, the Chriſtian muſt conclude, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:34034:27"/> 
                  <hi>he muſt make this his Rule, or elſe have no part in the Promiſes of the Goſpel. What then, O God, muſt I fear of my ſelf, who am ſo eaſie in admitting, and ſo careleſs in overcoming, what is thus contrary to my Profeſſion! I profeſs the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, but follow Inclination; and is this to be a Chriſtian?</hi>

               <p>A. <hi>It ſpeaks ſo plain in this Point, that no Chriſtian can be ignorant of his Obligation.</hi>

Dearly beloved, avenge not your ſelves, but give place unto wrath, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 16, 18. I beſeech to walk worthy of the vocation, wherewith ye are called: With all lowlineſs and meekneſs, with long-ſuffering, forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another in love; endeavouring to keep the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Spirit, in the Bond of Peace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3. For God is not the Author of Confuſion, but of Peace, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 33. He that will love life and ſee good days, let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain his tongue from evil,—let him ſeek Peace, and enſue it: Be ye all of one mind, having compaſſion one of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; love, as Brethren, be Pitiful, be Courteous; not rendring Evil for

Follow Peace with all men, and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord: Looking diligently, leſt any man fail of the Grace of God; leſt any root of bitterneſs ſpringing up, trouble you, and thereby many be defiled, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14, 15. Let us walk honeſtly as in the day,—not in ſtrife and envying; but put ye on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 13. Let nothing be done thro' ſtrife.—Do all things without mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings and diſputings; that ye may be blameleſs and harmleſs, the Sons of God in the midſt of a crooked and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe nation, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 3, 14. By love ſerve one another; for all the Law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou ſhalt thy Neighbor, as thy ſelf: But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed, that ye be not conſum'd one of another. The Fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit: Now the Works of the Fleſh are manifeſt, which are theſe;—Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, Variance, Emulations, Wrath,

But the Fruit of the Spirit, is, Love, Joy, Peace, Long-ſuffering, Gentleneſs, Goodneſs, Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:—againſt ſuch there is no Law.

We are Fools for Chriſt's ſake; but ye are wiſe in Chriſt; we are weak, but ye are ſtrong; ye are honorable, but we are deſpiſed:—We are made as the Filth of the World, and are the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcouring of all things unto this Day, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let nothing be done thro' Strife, or Vain-Glory, but in Lowlineſs of Mind let each eſteem o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther better than themſelves.—Let this Mind be in you, which was alſo in Chriſt Jeſus; who being in the form of God, thought it no Robbery to be equal
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:34034:34"/> with God; but made himſelf of no Reputation, and took upon him the form of a Servant, and was made in the likeneſs of Men; and being found in faſhion as a Man, he humbled himſelf, and became obedient unto Death, even the Death of the Croſs; wherefore God alſo hath highly exalted him, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him a Name, which is above every Name, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 3, 5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now, that he aſcended, what is it, but that he alſo deſcended firſt into the lower parts of the Earth? <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 9.

Yea, all of you be ſubject one to another, and be clothed with Humility: for God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth the Proud, and giveth Grace to the Humble.

God hath choſen the fooliſh things of the World, to confound the wiſe: and God hath choſen the weak things of the World, to confound the things, which are mighty; and baſe things of the World, and things, which are deſpiſed, hath God choſen—that no Fleſh ſhould glory in his Preſence:—He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 27. For not he, that commendeth himſelf, is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 18. Ye are they, which juſtifie your ſelves before Men; but God knoweth your Hearts: for that, which is highly eſteemed amongſt Men, is Abomination in the Sight of God, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 15. How can ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, which receive Honor one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſeek not the Honor, that cometh

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus plainly ſpeaks the Rule: And now, if upon a ſerious weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe Particulars, it does ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that a Univerſal Humility is moſt preſſingly recommended, and Pride is condemn'd in all its Branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; then it muſt be own'd, that in whatever way we ſeek Glory with Men, and deſire to be rais'd in the Opinion of the World; in whatever way we labor to magnifie this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Clay, give our ſelves the Preference to others, and, in our Hearts, deſpiſe our Neighbor; ſo often we forſake our Rule, and by a juſt Judgment upon Pride, are ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring our ſelves eternally contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:34034:35"/>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If this be ſo, then, I think, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians have Reaſon to conſider, and reform the general Method of their Lives. For, if looking upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they ſee the great Buſineſs of their Thoughts, their Study, their Contrivance, their Expences, is in the Service of Pride; that in this they place their Happineſs, for this they deny themſelves, ſuffer many Inconveniencies, hazard their Health, exhauſt their Eſtates,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>muſt not they, in this, ſee, they make Idols of themſelves, and for this ſelf-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, deſpiſe all the Inſtructions Chriſt has given them, and forſake his Goſpel? And can this way, this Martyrdom of Self-love ever bring them to Heaven? What then do they do? Believe in Chriſt and his Promiſes, and yet live in Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to both! This is, in Fact, to renounce both our Reaſon and Faith; Heaven can never be the Reward of ſuch inſolent and wilful Madneſs: They muſt either follow the Ways</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:34034:36"/> 
                  <hi>of the Goſpel, or lay by the Hopes of its Promiſes. Chriſtians are a People, that make Profeſſion of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Law of Chriſt: And yet in this Point, all are ſtriving to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do one another in departing from it; in forſaking the Ways of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and following thoſe of Pride.</hi>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> WHAT Directions does the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel give, as to theſe Points?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>They are all forbid: For ſince the Goſpel commands us</hi> to love our Neighbors as our ſelves, <hi>and to</hi> do to all Men, as we would, that Men ſhould do to us; <hi>it is evident, what Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we are to make of Detraction or ſpeaking Evil of our Neighbors, which is ſo contrary to theſe Two great Precepts of the new Law. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction then is the Tranſgreſſion of</hi>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:34034:36"/> 
                  <hi>all, that it is ſo poſitively commanded us in the Love of our Neighbor, above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd,</hi> c. 9. <hi>and is yet more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly forbid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God gave them over to a reprobate Mind, to do thoſe things, which are not convenient; being filled with—Maliciouſneſs; full of Envy,—Debate, Deceit, Malignity; Whiſperers, Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biters,—Deſpiteful, Proud, Boaſters, Inventers of evil things,—Covenant-Breakers:—Who knowing the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, (that they, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſuch things, are worthy of Death) not only do the ſame, but have Pleaſure in them, that do them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 28, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I fear, leſt when I come, I ſhall not find you ſuch, as I would;—leſt there be Debates, Envyings, Wraths, Strifes, Backbitings, Whiſperings, Swellings, Tumults, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 20. Wherefore laying aſide all Malice, and all Guile, and Hypocriſies, and Envyings, and all Evil-ſpeakings, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1. Speak not Evil one of another, Brethren. He that ſpeaketh Evil of his Brother, and judgeth his Brother, ſpeaketh Evil of the Law, and judgeth the Law: But,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:34034:37"/> if thou judge the Law, thou art not a Doer of the Law, but a Judge. There is one Law-giver, who is able to ſave and to deſtroy; who art thou, that judgeſt another? <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 11.

               <p>
                  <hi>Thus ſpeaks the Rule; and while it ſets Detraction, or Backbiting, and Reviling, and Whiſpering, among thoſe Sins, which exclude from the Poſſeſſion of God; what muſt be ſaid, but that they, who do theſe things, either know not their Rule, or think that by Cuſtom 'tis made void? If ſomething of this were not, how ſhould thoſe, who profeſs to believe and follow the Goſpel, live on in the open Breach of it, and make that their general Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:34034:37"/> 
                  <hi>which is here declar'd a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of Happineſs?

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> WHAT Directions does the Goſpel give as to the Points of Watchfulneſs and Idleneſs?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It ſpeaks plain enough.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Watch and pray, that ye enter not into Temptation, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 41. Let your Loins be girded about, and your Lights burning; and ye your ſelves like unto Men, that wait for their Lord, when he will return from the Wedding, that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately. Bleſſed are thoſe Servants, whom the Lord, when he cometh, ſhall find watching.—And if he ſhall come in the ſecond Watch, or come in the third Watch, and find them ſo, bleſſed are thoſe Servants. And this know, that if the good Man of the Houſe had known what Hour the Thief would
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:34034:38"/> come, he would have watched, and not have ſuffered his Houſe to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken through. Be ye therefore ready al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; for the Son of Man cometh at an Hour, when ye think not.—Bleſſed is that Servant, whom his Lord, when he cometh, ſhall find ſo doing: of a Truth I ſay unto you, that he will make him Ruler over all that he hath. But, and if that Servant ſay in his Heart, my Lord delayeth his coming; and ſhall begin to beat the Men-ſervants and Maidens, and to eat, and drink, and to be drunken: the Lord of that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant will come in a Day, when he looketh not for him, and at an Hour, when he is not aware, and will cut him in ſunder, and will appoint him his Portion with the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 35, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Take heed to your ſelves, leſt at any time your Hearts be overcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Surfeiting, and Drunkenneſs, and Cares of this Life, and ſo that Day come upon you unawares. For as a Snare ſhall it come on all them, that dwell on the Face of the whole Earth: Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:34034:39"/> eſcape all theſe things, that ſhall come to paſs, and to ſtand before the Son of Man, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21. 34. Take ye heed, watch and pray; for ye know not when the time is. For the Son of Man is as a Man taking a far Journey, who left his Houſe, and gave Authority to his Servants, and to every Man his Work, and commanded the Porter to watch. Watch ye therefore (for ye know not, when the Maſter of the Houſe cometh; at Even, or at Midnight, or at the Cock-crowing, or in the Morning) leſt coming ſuddenly he find you ſleeping: and what I ſay unto you, I ſay unto all, watch, <hi>Mar.</hi> 13. 33, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Watch therefore, for ye know, neither the Day nor the Hour, wherein the Son of Man cometh. For the Kingdom of Heaven is as a Man travelling into a far Country, who called his own Servants, and delivered unto them his Goods.—Then he, that had received the Five Talents, went and traded with the ſame, and made them other Five Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents.—But he, that had received one, went and digged in the Earth, and hid his Lord's Money. After a long time,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:34034:39"/> the Lord of thoſe Servants cometh, and reckoneth with them. And ſo he that had received Five Talents, came and brought other five Talents, ſaying, Lord, thou deliveredſt unto me Five Talents; behold I have gained beſides them Five Talents more. His Lord ſaid unto him; Well done, thou good and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servant: thou haſt been faithful over a few things; I will make thee Ruler over many things; enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord.—Then he, which had received the one Talent, came.—His Lord ſaid unto him; Thou wicked and ſlothful Servant;—Take therefore the Talent from him, and give it unto him, which hath Ten Talents,—and caſt ye the unprofitable Servant into outer Darkneſs; there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 13. And now alſo the Ax is laid unto the Root of the Trees: therefore every Tree, which bringeth not forth good Fruit, is hewn down, and caſt into the Fire, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 10. A certain Man had a Fig-tree planted in his Vineyard, and he came and ſought Fruit thereon, and found none. Then ſaid he unto the Dreſſer of his
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:34034:40"/> Vineyard; Behold, theſe Three Years I come ſeeking Fruit on this Fig-tree, and find none; Cut it down, why cumbreth it the Ground? And he anſwering, ſaid unto him, Lord, let it alone this Year alſo, till I ſhall dig about it, and dung it; and if it bear Fruit, well; and if not, then after that thou ſhalt cut it down, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 6. Not every one, that ſaith unto me, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; but he that doth the Will of my Father, which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 21. Strive to enter in at the ſtrait Gate: for many, I ſay unto you, will ſeek to enter in, and ſhall not be able, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 24. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ye in at the ſtrait Gate; for wide is the Gate, and broad is the Way, that leadeth to Deſtruction, and many there be, which go in thereat: becauſe ſtrait is the Gate, and narrow is the Way, which leadeth unto Life, and few there are, that find it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 13. Seek, and ye ſhall find; knock, and it ſhall be opened unto you, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 7. Seek ye firſt the Kingdom of God, and his Righteouſneſs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 33. The
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:34034:40"/> Kingdom af Heaven ſuffereth Violence, and the violent take it by force, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 12. If any Man will come after me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his croſs daily, and follow me. For whoſoever will ſave his Life, ſhall loſe it, but whoſoever will loſe his Life, for my ſake, the ſame ſhall ſave it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. 23. If any Man come to me, and hate not his Father, and Mother, and Wife, and Children, and Brethren, and Siſters, yea, and his own Life al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, he cannot be my Diſciple. And whoſoever doth not bear his Croſs, and come after me, cannot be my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.—Whoſoever he be of you, that forſaketh not all, that he hath, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be my Diſciple, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. 26, 33. A certain Man made a great Supper, and bade many; and ſent his Servant at Supper-time, to ſay to them, that were bidden, Come, for all things are now ready. And they all with one conſent began to make excuſe. Then the Maſter of the Houſe being angry, ſaid;—I ſay unto you, that none of thoſe Men, that were bidden, ſhall taſte of my Supper, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Be not deceived; God is not mocked: For whatſoever a Man ſoweth, that ſhall he alſo reap. For he that ſoweth to his Fleſh, ſhall of the Fleſh reap Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, but he that ſoweth to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſhall of the Spirit reap Life Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting: And let us not be weary in well-doing; for in due Seaſon we ſhall reap, if we faint not, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 7.

God is not unrighteous, to forget your work and labour of Love, which ye have ſhewed toward his name, in that ye have miniſter'd to the Saints, and do miniſter. And we deſire, that every one of you do ſhew the ſame Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, to the full Aſſurance of Hope unto the end: That ye be not Slothful, but Followers of them, who thro' Faith and Patience inherit the Promiſes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 10. Work out your own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation with Fear and Trembling, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 12. Know ye not, that they, which run in a Race, run all, but one receiveth the Prize? So run, that ye may obtain. And every Man, that ſtriveth for the Maſtery, is temperate in all things: Now they do it, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a corruptible Crown, but we an incorruptible. I therefore ſo run, not as uncertainly: So fight I, not as one, that beateth the Air: But I keep under my Body, and bring it into Subjection; leſt that by any means, when I have preached to others, I my ſelf ſhould be a Caſt-away, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 24, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Many are called, but few are choſen, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 14. Wherefore the

It muſt then be remember'd, that the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt requires of all his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers a Watchful Life, and that Idleneſs, Sloth, and a conſtant Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipation of Mind are contrary to it, and therefore to be avoided.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> WHAT Directions does the Goſpel give, as to this point.</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It ſhews it to be very diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God, and ſtrictly cautions all againſt it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ye have heard, that it was ſaid by them of old time, Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery: But I ſay unto you, that whoſoever looketh on a Woman, to luſt after her, hath committed Adultery with her already in his Heart. And if thy right Eye offend thee, pluck it out, and caſt it from thee; for it is profitable for thee, that one of thy Members ſhould periſh, and not thy whole Body ſhould be caſt into Hell, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 27. Let not Sin therefore Reign in your mortal Body, that ye ſhould o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey it in the Luſts thereof, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 12. When they knew God, they glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified him not as God;—wherefore God alſo gave them up to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:34034:44"/> thro' the Luſts of their own Hearts, to diſhonor their own Bodies.—For this Cauſe God gave them up unto vile Affections, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 21, 24, 26. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, Brethren, by the Mercies of God, that ye preſent your Bodies a living Sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reaſonable Service; and be not conformed to this World, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1. To be carnally minded, is Death;—becauſe the carnal Man is Enmity againſt God.—We are Debters, not to the Fleſh, to live after the Fleſh; for if ye live after the Fleſh, ye ſhall die: But if ye, thro' the Spirit, do mortifie the deeds of the Body, ye ſhall live, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 6, 7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They that are Chriſt's, have crucified the Fleſh, with the Affections and Luſts, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 24. This I ſay therefore and teſtifie in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not, as other Gentiles walk, in the Vanity of their Mind, having the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding darkned, being alienated from the Life of God;—who being paſt feeling have given themſelves over unto Laſciviouſneſs, to work all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs with greedineſs: But ye have not ſo
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:34034:45"/> learned Chriſt; if ſo be that ye have heard him;—that ye put off, concerning the former Converſation, the Old Man, which is Corrupt, according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Luſts.—Let no corrupt Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication proceed out of your Mouth, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But Fornication and all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs, or Covetouſneſs, let it not be once named amongſt you, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh Saints; neither Filthineſs nor fooliſh Talking, nor Jeſting, which are not convenient, but rather giving of Thanks: For this ye know, that no Whoremonger, nor unclean Perſon, nor Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous Man, who is an Idolater, hath any Inheritance in the Kingdom of Chriſt, and of God.—Have no Fellowſhip with the unfruitful Works of Darkneſs, but rather reprove them; for it is a ſhame even to ſpeak of thoſe things, which are done of them in Secret, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mortifie therefore your Members, which are upon the Earth, Fornication, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs, inordinate Affection, evil Concupiſcence, and Covetouſneſs, which is Idolatry: For which things ſake, the Wrath of God cometh on the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Diſobedience:—But now you
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:34034:45"/> alſo put off all theſe; Anger, Wrath, Malice, Blaſphemy, Filthy Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of your Mouth, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For this is the Will of God, even your Sanctification, that ye ſhould abſtain from Fornication: that every one of you ſhould know how to poſſeſs his Veſſel in Sanctification and Honor; not in the Luſt of Concupiſcence, even as the Gentiles, which know not God.—For God hath not called us unto <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but unto Holineſs, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Walk in the Spirit, and ye ſhall not fulfil the Luſt of the Fleſh.—Now the Works of the Fleſh are manifeſt, which are theſe; Adultery, Fornication, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Laciviouſneſs—and ſuch like; of the which I tell you before, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo told you in time paſt, that they, which do ſuch things, ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 16, 19. Dearly beloved, I beſeech you, as Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Pilgrims, abſtain from fleſhly Luſts, which War againſt the Soul: Having your Converſation honeſt among the Gentiles, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 11. Let us live honeſtly, as in the Day; not in Rioting and Drunkenneſs, not in Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:34034:46"/> and Wantonneſs, not in Strife and Envying; but put ye on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and make not Proviſion for the Fleſh, to fulfil the Luſts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 13. Dearly Beloved, let us cleanſe our ſelves from all Filthineſs of the Fleſh and Spirit, perfecting holineſs in the fear of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1. If any Man love the World, the Love of the Father is not in him. For all, that is in the World, the Luſt of the Fleſh, and the Luſt of the Eyes, and the Pride of Life, is not of the Father, but is of the World: And the World paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth away, and the Luſt thereof, but he, that doeth the Will of God, abideth for ever, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Every Man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own Luſt, and enticed: Then, when Luſt hath conceived, it bringeth forth Sin; and Sin, when it is finiſhed, bringeth forth Death, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 14. Now I have written unto you, not to keep Company, if any Man, that is called a Brother, be a Fornicator, or Covetous, or an Idolater, or a Railer, or a Drunkard, or an Extortioner, with ſuch an one, no not to eat, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. Be not deceived,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:34034:46"/> neither Fornicators, nor Idolaters, nor Adulterers, nor Effeminate, nor A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſers of themſelves with Mankind,—ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9. Marriage is honorable in all, and the Bed undefiled: But Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers and Adulterers God will judge, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 4. As you have yielded your Members Servants to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs and to Iniquity, unto Iniquity; even ſo now yield your Members Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to Righteouſneſs, unto Holineſs.—What Fruit had ye then in thoſe things, whereof ye are now aſhamed? For the end of thoſe things is Death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 19, 21.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus ſpeaks the Rule: And is not here expreſly declar'd, how cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal all kind of Impurity is in the ſight of God, whether it be in the Heart only or Deſire, or by Inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Affections, or in the Eyes, or in the Tongue, or in Actions? All kind of Senſuality and Uncleanneſs, both of Mind and Body, are here forbid, and mark'd with the Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Character, of being the Sins of the Gentiles or Heathens, who</hi>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:34034:47"/> 
                  <hi>knew not God, who for their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs were given up to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate Senſe. It is evident then, that all ſuch Offences are an Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute tranſgreſſion of the Chriſtian's Rule; and that to live in the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of them, is to live as a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then. What then muſt be done? The Chriſtian muſt remember, that the Promiſe of ſeeing God, is made to the Pure and Clean of heart; that without this, he can have no part in this Promiſe: That therefore he muſt dailyl labor to bring his Heart to this happy diſpoſition: He muſt reſiſt evil, avoid Ill company, keep a watch upon his Eyes, upon his Tongue, and upon his Heart; he muſt put a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint upon himſelf as to all kind of dangerous liberties; and avoid all, that can defile, if he truly deſires, that his Heart ſhould be Clean. And is this the Goſpel? How few then are Choſen? Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min thy ſelf by what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle has ſaid;</hi> The Luſt of the fleſh, the Luſt of the eyes, the Pride of life,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:34034:47"/> are not of the Father, 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 2. 15. <hi>Do'ſt thou belong to him?</hi>

               <p>A. <hi>The Goſpel declares it to be abſolutely neceſſary for all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Jeſus ſaid to his Diſciples; if any man will come after me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me. For whoſoever will ſave his life, ſhall loſe it: And whoſoever will loſe his life, for my ſake, ſhall find it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 24. Whoſoever will come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter me, let him deny himſelf, <hi>Mar.</hi> 8. 34. If any man will come after me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs daily, and follow me, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. 23. If any man come to me, and hate not his Father, and Mother, and Wife, and Children, and Brethren, and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, yea, and his own Life alſo, he
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:34034:48"/> cannot be my Diſciple. And whoſoever doth not bear his Croſs, and come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter me, cannot be my Diſciple. For which of you intending to build a Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſitteth not down firſt, and counteth the coſt, whether he have ſufficient to finiſh it?—So likewiſe, whoſoever he be of you, that forſaketh not all, that he hath, he cannot be my Diſciple, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. 26, 33. If thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and caſt it from thee; for it is profitable for thee, that one of thy members ſhould periſh, and not that thy whole body ſhould be caſt into Hell, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 30. He, that loveth his life, ſhall loſe it; and he, that hateth his life in this world, ſhall keep it unto life eternal, <hi>Jo.</hi> 12. 25. Reckon ye alſo your ſelves to be dead indeed unto Sin; but alive unto God, thro' Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. Let not ſin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye ſhould obey it in the luſts thereof. Neither yield ye your members as inſtruments of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, unto ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 11. I ſee another law in my members, warring againſt the law of my mind, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me into captivity to the law of ſin,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:34034:48"/> which is in my members. O wretched man, that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death! <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 23. Brethren, we are debtors, not to the fleſh, to live after the fleſh. For if ye live after the fleſh, ye ſhall die: But if ye, thro' the Spirit, do mortifie the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live: For as many, as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 12. Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt? Shall tribulation, or diſtreſs, or perſecution?—Nay, in all theſe things we are more than conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, thro' him that loved us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 35. If we have been planted together in the likeneſs of his death, we ſhall be alſo in the likeneſs of his reſurrection: Knowing this, that our Old man is crucified with him, that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve ſin.—Now, if we be dead with Chriſt, we believe, that we ſhall alſo live with him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 5, 8. I beſeech you, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye preſent your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies a living Sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reaſonable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice:
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:34034:49"/> and be not conformed to this world: But be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove, what is that good, and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and perfect will of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1. Every man, that ſtriveth for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, is temperate in all things: Now they do it, to obtain a corruptible Crown, but we an incorruptible. I therefore ſo run, not as uncertainly; ſo fight I, not as one, that beateth the air: But I keep unto my body, and bring it under ſubjection; leſt that by any means, when I have preached to others, I my ſelf ſhould be a caſt-away, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 25. Always bearing about in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the dying of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that the life alſo of Jeſus might be made manifeſt in our body, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 10. He died for all, that they, which live, ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto him, which died for them, and roſe again.—Therefore, if any man be in Chriſt, he is a new creature; old things are paſt away, behold, all things are become new, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 15, 17. I am crucified with Chriſt; nevertheleſs, I live; yet not
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:34034:49"/> I, but Chriſt liveth in me: And the life, which I now live in the Fleſh, I live by the Faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himſelf for me, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. Walk in the Spirit, and ye ſhall not fulfil the luſt of the fleſh: For the fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit; and the Spirit againſt the fleſh.—If we live in the Spirit, let us alſo walk in the ſpirit. They that are Chriſt's, have crucified the fleſh, with the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and luſts, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 16, 24. Henceforth let no man trouble me; for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jeſus, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 17. I do count all things but loſs, for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord; for whom I have ſuffered the loſs of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Chriſt:—That I may know him, and the power of his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and the fellowſhip of his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, being made conformable unto his death, if by any means I might attain unto the reſurrection of the dead, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8. Put off, concerning the former conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful luſts, and be
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:34034:50"/> renewed in the ſpirit of your mind; and that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteouſneſs and true holineſs, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 22. The Grace of God, that bringeth Salvation, hath appeared to all men, teaching us, that denying ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and godly in this preſent world, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 12. Mortifie therefore your members, which are upon the earth; Fornication, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs, inordinate Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,—in the which ye alſo walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome time, when ye lived in them: But now you alſo put off all theſe—and have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge, after the image of him, that created him, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 5. Flee alſo youthful luſts: But follow righteouſneſs, Faith, Charity, Peace, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 22.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus ſpeaks the Rule; whence it is plain above all diſpute, that thoſe, who follow their Inclinations, do not follow this Rule. We have all an inheritance of Corruption, which bends us to ſin; this is entail'd on us from</hi> Adam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>and is call'd the Old</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:34034:50"/> 
                  <hi>Man; this the Goſpel commands us to put off; all ſuch then, as ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examin their Inclinations, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and Deſires, and reſolutely ſtand againſt thoſe, which they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be ſinful, or can ſuſpect as leading to ſin, are the Perſons, who live by the Rule, which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs; and if they ſtudy to improve thoſe better Impreſſions, which are the effects of Grace, it cannot be queſtion'd, but they will be cloath'd with the New Man, and, while in the Fleſh, even live by the Spirit. But this cannot be their Character, who being ſubject to great variety of Worldly and Senſual Inclinations, who finding no Reliſh in their Souls, but of what is in favor of their Pride, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Idleneſs and of Self-love in all its Shapes, are ſo far from uſing due means for ſuppreſſing them, that their whole Life is an Obedience to their demands; for certainly theſe have no regard to what the Goſpel preſcribes; their Life is a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to its Rules; they indulge</hi>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:34034:51"/> 
                  <hi>their Corruption, which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them to reſiſt; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being found under the Subjecti- of the old Man, can never expect, while under this Slavery, to come to the Liberty of the Children of God.

               <p>A. <hi>It ſpeaks very largely of them, and ſhews, with what Spirit a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ought to ſubmit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Bleſſed are they, which are perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for Righteouſneſs ſake; for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven. Bleſſed are ye, when Men ſhall revile you, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute you, and ſhall ſay all manner of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:34034:51"/> evil againſt you falſly, for my ſake: Rejoice, and be exceeding glad; for great is your Reward in Heaven: For ſo perſecuted they the Prophets, which were before you, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 10. Ye have heard, that it hath been ſaid; an Eye for an Eye, and a Tooth for a Tooth; but I ſay unto you, that ye reſiſt not Evil; but whoſoever ſhall ſmite thee on thy right Cheek, turn him the other alſo, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 38. He, that taketh not his Croſs, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me. He, that findeth his Life, ſhall loſe it; and he, that loſeth his Life for my ſake, ſhall find it. Fear not them, which kill the Body, but are not able to kill the Soul; but rather fear him, which is able to deſtroy both Soul and Body in Hell. Are not two Sparrows Sold for a Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? And one of them ſhall not fall on the Ground, without your Father: But the very Hairs of your Head are all number'd: Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more Value, than many Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows. Whoſoever therefore ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs me before Men, him will I confeſs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo before my Father, which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.—Think
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:34034:52"/> not, that I am come to ſend Peace on Earth, I came not to ſend Peace, but a Sword, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 38, 28. Behold, I ſend you forth as Sheep in the midſt of Wolves.—But beware of Men, for they will deliver you up to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and they will Scourge you in their Synagogues; and ye ſhall be brought before Governors and Kings, for my ſake.—And the Brother ſhall deliver up the Brother to Death, and the Father the Child: And the Children ſhall riſe up againſt their Parents, and cauſe them to be put to Death. And ye ſhall be hated of all Men, for my names ſake: But he, that endureth to the end ſhall be ſaved. The Diſciple is not above his Maſter, nor the Servant above his Lord. It is enough for the Diſciple, that be be, as his Maſter, and the Servant, as his Lord: If they have called the Maſter of the Houſe Beelze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub; how much more ſhall they call them of his Houſhold, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 16. Then ſhall they deliver you up to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, and ſhall kill you; and ye ſhall be hated of all Nations, for my names ſake, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 9. They ſhall put you
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:34034:52"/> out of the Synagogues; yea, the time cometh, that whoſoever killeth you, will think, that he doeth God Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.—Verily, verily I ſay unto you, that ye ſhall Weep and Lament; but the World ſhall rejoice and ye ſhall be ſorrowful; but your Sorrow ſhall be turned into Joy.—And ye now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have Sorrow; but I will ſee you again; and your Heart ſhall rejoice, and your Joy no Man taketh from you, <hi>Jo.</hi> 16. 2, 20.

For we know, that the whole Creation groaneth, and travelleth in Pain together, until now.—What ſhall we then ſay to theſe things? If God be for us, who can be againſt us?—Who ſhall ſeparate us from the Love of Chriſt? Shall Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, or Diſtreſs, or Perſecution, or Famine, or Nakedneſs, or Peril, or Sword? (As it is written, for thy ſake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as Sheep for the Slaughter:) Nay, in all theſe things, we are more than Conquerors, thro'
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:34034:53"/> him, that loved us. For I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that neither Death, nor Life, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor Height, nor Depth, nor any other Creature, ſhall be able to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate us from the Love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 22, 31, 35.</p>
               <p>I think that God hath ſet forth us the Apoſtles laſt, as it were appointed to Death: For we are made a Spectacle unto the World, and to Angels, and to Men. We are Fools for Chriſt's ſake, but ye are wiſe in Chriſt: We are weak, but ye are ſtrong: Ye are honorable, but we are deſpiſed. Even unto this preſent Hour, we both Hunger and Thirſt, and are Naked, and are Buffeted, and have no certain Dwelling-place; and labour, working with our own Hands: Being reviled, we bleſs; being perſecuted, we ſuffer it: Being defamed, we intreat: We are made as the Filth of the World, and are the off-ſcouring of all things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Day, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 9. Bleſſed be God, even the Father of our Lord
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:34034:54"/> Jeſus Chriſt, the Father of Mercies, and the God of all Comfort; who comforteth us in all our Tribulations;—for as the Sufferings of Chriſt abound in us, ſo our Conſolation alſo aboundeth by Chriſt.—For we would not, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, have you ignorant of our Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which came to us in <hi>Aſia,</hi> that we were preſſed out of Meaſure, above Strength, inſomuch that we deſpaired even of Life: But we had the Sentence of Death in our ſelves, that we ſhould not truſt in our ſelves, but in God, which raiſeth the Dead, who delivered us from ſo great a Death, and doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver; in whom we truſt, that he will yet deliver us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 3, 8. And our Hope of you is ſtedfaſt, knowing, that as you are Partakers of the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; ſo ſhall ye be alſo of the Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, <hi>Ib. v.</hi> 7. We have this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in earthen Veſſels, that the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Power may be of God, and not of us. We are troubled on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſide, yet not diſtreſſed; we are perplexed, but not in deſpair; perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, but not forſaken; caſt down, but not deſtroyed; always bearing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:34034:54"/> in the Body, the dying of the Lord Jeſus, that the Life alſo of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus might be made manifeſt in our Body. For we, which live, are always delivered unto Death for Jeſus ſake, that the Life alſo of Jeſus might be made manifeſt in our mortal Fleſh. So then Death worketh in us, but Life in you.—For which cauſe we faint not; but tho' our outward Man periſh, yet the inward Man is renewed day by day. For our light Affliction, which is but for a Moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal Weight of Glory; while we look not at the things, which are ſeen, but at the things, which are not ſeen: for the things, which are ſeen, are Temporal; but the things, which are not ſeen, are Eternal, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7, 16.</p>
               <p>I am filled with Comfort, I am ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding joyful in all our Tribulation. For when we were come into <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> our Fleſh had no reſt, but we were troubled on every ſide; without were Fightings, within were Fears. Nevertheleſs, God that comforteth thoſe, that are caſt down, comforted us by the coming of <hi>Titus,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 4. Ye
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:34034:55"/> ſuffer, if a Man bring you into Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, if a Man devour you, if a Man take of you, if a Man exalt himſelf, if a Man ſimite you on the Face.—Are they Miniſters of Chriſt? I am more: In Labours more abundant, in Stripes above meaſure, in Priſons more frequent, in Deaths oft. Of the <hi>Jews,</hi> five times received I forty Stripes ſave one. Thrice was I beaten with Rods, once was I Stoned, thrice I ſuffered Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack; a Night and a Day I have been in the Deep: In Journeying often, in Perils of Waters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in Perils of Robbers, in Perils by my own Countrymen, in Perils by the Heathen, in Perils in the City, in Perils in the Wilderneſs, in Perils in the Sea, in Perils among falſe Brethren.—In <hi>Damaſcus</hi> the Governor under <hi>Aretas</hi> the King, kept the City of the <hi>Damaſcens</hi> with a Gariſon, deſirous to apprehend me; and thro' a Window in a Basket was I let down by the Wall, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped his Hands, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 20, 23. Leſt I ſhould be exalted above Meaſure thro' the abundance of the Revelations, there was given to me a Thorn in the Fleſh, the Meſſenger of Satan to buffet me, leſt I ſhould be exalted above Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:34034:55"/> For this thing I beſought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. And he ſaid unto me, my Grace is ſufficient for thee: For my Strength is made perfect in Weakneſs. Moſt gladly therefore will I rather glory in my Infirmities, that the Power of Chriſt may reſt upon me. Therefore I take Pleaſure in Infirmities, in Reproaches, in Neceſſities, in Perſecutions, in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes for Chriſt's ſake: For when I am weak, then am I ſtrong, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. What things were Gain to me, thoſe I counted Loſs for Chriſt.

               <p>We our ſelves glory in you in the Churches of God, for your Patience and Faith in all your Perſecutions and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations, that ye endure: which is a manifeſt Token of the Righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the Kingdom of God, for which ye alſo ſuffer; ſeeing it is a righteous thing with God, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence Tribulation to them, that trouble you; and to you, who are troubled, reſt with us, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 4. I ſuffer Trouble, as an evil Doer, even unto Bonds; but the Word of God is not bound. Therefore I endure all things, for the Elect's ſakes, that they may alſo obtain the Salvation, which is in Chriſt Jeſus, with Eternal Glory. It is a faithful Saying: for if we be dead with him, we ſhall alſo live with him: if we ſuffer, we ſhall alſo reign with him; if we deny him, he alſo will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

We ſee Jeſus, who was made a little lower than the Angels, for the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Death, crowned with Glory and Honour; that he, by the Grace of God, ſhould taſte Death for every Man. For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many Sons unto Glory, to make the Captain of their Salvation perfect thro' Sufferings, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 9. Tho' he were a Son, yet learned he Obedience, by the things which he ſuffered: and being made perfect, he became the Author of eternal Salvation unto all them, that obey him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 8. It is a fearful thing to fall into the Hands of the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, but call to Remembrance the former Days, in which, after ye were
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:34034:57"/> illuminated, ye endured a great fight of Afflictions: partly, whilſt ye were made a gazing-ſtock, both by Reproaches and Afflictions; and partly, whilſt ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Companions of them, that were ſo uſed. For ye had Compaſſion of me in my Bonds, and took joyfully the ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your Goods, knowing in your ſelves, that ye have in Heaven a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and an enduring Subſtance. Caſt not away therefore your Confidence, which hath great Recompence of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. For ye have need of Patience; that after ye have done the Will of God, ye might receive the Promiſe. For yet a little while, and he, that ſhall come, will come, and will not tarry. Now the juſt ſhall live by Faith: but if any Man draw back, my Soul ſhall have no Pleaſure in him. But we are not of them, who draw back unto Perdition; but of them, that believe, to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Soul, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 31. By Faith, <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he was come to Years, refuſed to be called the Son of <hi>Pharoah</hi>'s Daughter; chuſing rather to ſuffer Affliction with the People of God, than to enjoy the Pleaſures of Sin
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:34034:57"/> for a ſeaſon; eſteeming the Reproach of Chriſt, greater Riches, than the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of <hi>Egypt;</hi> for he had Reſpect unto the Recompence of the Reward—What ſhall I more ſay—of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, who, thro' Faith ſubdued King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, wrought Righteouſneſs, obtain'd Promiſes, ſtopped the Mouths of Lions, quenched the Violence of Fire?—O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were tortured, not accepting De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance; that they might obtain a better Reſurrection. And others had Trial of cruel Mockings and Scourg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, yea, moreover of Bonds and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment. They were ſtoned, they were ſawn aſunder, were tempted, were ſlain with the Sword; they wander'd about in Sheep-skins and Goat-skins, being deſtitute, afflicted, tormented: (of whom the World was not worthy) they wander'd in Deſarts, and in Mountains, and in Dens and Caves of the Earth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 23, 32. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing we alſo are compaſſed about with ſo great a Cloud of Witneſſes, let us lay aſide every weight, and the Sin, which doth ſo eaſily beſet us, and let us run with Patience the Race, that is
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:34034:58"/> ſet before us, looking unto Jeſus, the Author and Finiſher of our Faith; who, for the Joy that was ſet before him, endured tbe Croſs, deſpiſing the Shame, and is ſet down at the Right Hand of the Throne of God. For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider him, that endured ſuch Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of Sinners againſt himſelf, leſt ye be wearied and faint in your Minds. Ye have not yet reſiſted unto Blood, ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving againſt Sin. And ye have forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Exhortation, which ſpeaketh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, as unto Children; My Son, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe not thou the chaſtening of the Lord, nor faint, when thou art rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of him: for whom the Lord loveth, he chaſteneth, and ſcourgeth every Son, whom he receiveth. If ye endure cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening, God dealeth with you, as with Sons: for what Son is he, whom the Father chaſteneth not? But if ye be without Chaſtiſement, whereof all are Partakers, then are ye Baſtards, and not Sons. Furthermore, we have had Fathers of our fleſh, which corrected us, and we gave them Reverence: ſhall we not much rather be in Subjection unto the Father of Spirits and live?
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:34034:58"/> For they verily for a few Days chaſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, after their own Pleaſure; but he for our Profit, that we might be Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his Holineſs. Now, no cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening for the preſent ſeemeth to be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but grievous: nevertheleſs, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it yieldeth the peaceable Fruit of Righteouſneſs unto them, which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed thereby. Wherefore, lift up the Hands, which hang down, and the feeble Knees, and make ſtraight Paths for your Feet, leſt that, which is lame, be turned out of the way, but let it rather be healed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> preached the Goſpel—confirming the Souls of the Diſciples, and exhorting them to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in the Faith, and that we muſt, thro' much Tribulation, enter into the Kingdom of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 22. And now, behold, I go bound in the Spirit unto <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> not knowing the things that ſhall befal me there: ſave that the Holy Ghoſt witneſſeth in every Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſaying, that Bonds and Afflictions abide me. But none of theſe things move me, neither count I my Life dear unto my ſelf, ſo that I might finiſh my

My Brethren, count it all Joy, when ye fall into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Temptations; knowing this, that the trying of your Faith worketh Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. But let Patience have her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.—Bleſſed is the Man, that endureth Temptation; for when he is tried, he ſhall receive the Crown of Life, which the Lord hath promiſed to them, that love him, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 2, 12. Take, my Brethren, the Prophets, who have ſpoken in the Name of the Lord, for an Example of ſuffering Affliction, and of Patience. Behold, we count them happy, which endure. Ye have heard of the Patience of <hi>Job,</hi> and have ſeen the end of the Lord: that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 10. This is thank-worthy, if a Man, for
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:34034:59"/> Conſcience toward God, endure Grief, ſuffering wrongfully. For what Glory is it, if when ye be buffetted for your Faults, ye ſhall take it patiently? But, if, when ye do well, and ſuffer for it, ye take it patiently; this is acceptable with God. For even hereunto were ye called: becauſe Chriſt alſo ſuffered for us, leaving us an Example, that ye ſhould follow his ſteps: who did no Sin, neither was Guile found in his Mouth: who, when he was revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, reviled not again; when he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, he threatned not; but commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelf to him, that judgeth righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly: who his own ſelf bare our Sins in his own Body on the Tree, that we being dead to Sin, ſhould live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Righteouſneſs; by whoſe Stripes ye were healed, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 19.</p>
               <p>Who is he, that will harm you, if ye be followers of that, which is good? But, and if ye ſuffer for Righteouſneſs ſake, happy are ye: and be not afraid of their Terror, neither be troubled; but ſanctifie the Lord God in your Hearts:—for it is better, if the Will of God be ſo, that ye ſuffer for well-doing,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:34034:60"/> than for evil-doing. For Chriſt alſo hath once ſuffered for Sins, the juſt for the unjuſt, (that he might bring us to God) being put to death in the Fleſh, but quickned by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 13, 17. Beloved, think it not ſtrange concerning the fiery trial, which is to try you, as tho' ſame ſtrange thing happen'd unto you: but rejoice, in as much as ye are Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of Chriſt's Sufferings; that when his Glory ſhall be revealed, ye may be glad alſo with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Joy. If ye be reproached for the Name of Chriſt, happy are ye; for the Spirit of Glory, and of God, reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon you: on their part he is evil ſpoken of, but on your part he is glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. But let none of you ſuffer as a Murtherer, or as a Thief, or as an evil Doer, or as a Buſie-body in other Men's Matters. Yet if any Man ſuffer as a Chriſtian, let him not be aſhamed; but let him glorifie God on this behalf. For the time is come, that Judgment muſt begin at the Houſe of God: and if it firſt begin at us, what ſhall the end be of them, that obey not the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:34034:60"/> of God? And if the righteous ſcarcely be ſaved; where ſhall the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly and the Sinner appear? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let them, that ſuffer according to the Will of God, commit the keeping of their Souls to him in well-doing, as unto a faithful Creator, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 12. What are theſe, which are arrayed in white Robes? And whence came they? And I ſaid unto him, Sir, thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. And he ſaid to me; Theſe are they, which came out of great Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and have waſhed their Robes, and made them white in the Blood of the Lamb. Therefore are they before the Throne of God, and ſerve him Day and Night in his Temple:—and God ſhall wipe away all Tears from their Eyes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus ſpeaks the Rule; ſo full and plain, that a Chriſtian muſt hence ſee, what Judgment he is to frame of all the Afflictions of this Life, and what uſe he is to make of them. He is to conſider them as the Effect of the Divine Will, as the Trial and Improvement of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, as the Exerciſe of Patience, as</hi>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:34034:61"/> 
                  <hi>the Portion, which Chriſt choſe for himſelf, and for his beſt Servants; and hence, that by a due Submiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them, they may be very ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable in the gaining an eternal Crown. Therefore in practice, he is neither to murmur, nor ſink in Spirit under them, as under Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes; but firſt endeavor to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit with Reſolution, as to the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Ordinance of the Divine Will, and then even to receive with Comfort, what God knows to be beſt for him, and may be very advantageous to him for obtaining Mercy and Glory. Thus the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel directs. Such then, as ſincerely deſire to be Followers of it, muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to compoſe their Spirits in this manner, under all kind of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions; that is, with Meekneſs, Patience, Humility, Submiſſion and Comfort, for this is the Spirit of the Goſpel; and they, who take no Pains, or very little, to come into this Method, but yield to the Inclinations of Nature, in grieving, fretting, murmuring,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>it is plain,</hi>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:34034:61"/> 
                  <hi>as far, as they wilfully or affected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow Nature in this Point, ſo far they depart from the Goſpel.</hi>

Wherein ye greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice, tho' now for a Seaſon (if need be) ye are in Heavineſs, thro' mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Temptations: That the Trial of your Faith, being much more precious than of Gold that periſheth, tho' it be tried with Fire, might be found unto Praiſe, and Honor, and Glory at the appearing of Jeſus Chriſt; whom ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not ſeen ye love, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 6.

               <p>Fear none of thoſe things, which thou ſhalt ſuffer: Behold the Devil ſhall caſt ſome of you into Priſon, that ye may be tried: And ye ſhall have Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation Ten Days: Be thou Faithful unto Death, and I will give thee a Crown of Life, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 10.</p>

God tempts no Man, it being whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Inconſiſtent with his Goodneſs.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>That with great Watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he is to obſerve theſe Deſigns of his Enemy, and with Reſolution ſtand againſt them; and that upon ſo doing he cannot fail of being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror thro' God's aſſiſting Grace.</hi>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> HAving ſeen, what the Goſpel di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects in theſe General Duties, which belong to all, that profeſs the Name of Chriſt; let me now hear, what it ſays to the Particular States of Chriſtians; that ſo, having this drawn under ſeveral Heads, every one may have the Opportunity of ſeeing, what is the Will of God in regard of them, and what Inſtructions Chriſt has laid upon them. And Firſt, What do's the Goſpel ſay of Virgins?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It ſpeaks very particularly of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:34034:65"/>
               <p> There are ſome Eunuchs, which were ſo born from their Mothers Womb: And there are ſome Eunuchs, which were made Eunuchs of Men: And there be Eunuchs which have made themſelves Eunuchs, for the Kingdom of Heaven's ſake. He that is able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, let him receive it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 12. The Kingdom of Heaven ſhall be likened unto Ten Virgins, which took their Lamps, and went forth to meet the Bridegroom. And Five of them were Wiſe, and Five were Fooliſh. They, that were Fooliſh, took their Lamps, and took no Oyl with them: But the Wiſe took Oyl in their Veſſels, with their Lamps.—The Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom came, and they that were ready, went in with him to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and the Door was ſhut. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward came alſo the other Virgins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaying, Lord, Lord, open to us: But he anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſaid; Verily, I ſay unto you, I know you not. Watch therefore, for ye know neither the Day nor the Hour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 1. It is good for a Man not to touch a Woman. Nevertheleſs, to avoid For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, let every Man have his own
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:34034:65"/> Wife, and let every Woman have her own Husband.—But I ſpeak this by Permiſſion, and not of Commandment. For I would that all Men were even as I my ſelf: But every Man hath his proper Gift of God, one after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and another after that. I ſay therefore to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nmarried and Widows, it is good for them, if they abide even as I. But if they cannot contain, let them Marry: For it is better to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry than to Burn.—But, as God hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed to every Man, as the Lord hath called every one, ſo let him walk; and ſo ordain I in all the Churches.—Now concerning Virgins, I have no Commandment of the Lord: Yet I give my Judgment, as one, that hath obtained Mercy of the Lord to be faithful. I ſuppoſe therefore, that this is good for the preſent diſtreſs, I ſay, that it is good for a Man ſo to be. Art thou bound unto a Wife? Seek not to be looſed. Art thou looſed from a Wife? Seek not a Wife.—But I would have you without Carefulneſs. He, that is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nmarried careth for the things, that belong to the Lord, how he may
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:34034:66"/> pleaſe the Lord: But he, that is Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, careth for the things that are of the World, how he may pleaſe his Wife. Thee is difference alſo between a Wife and a Virgin: The unmarried Woman careth for the things of the Lord, that ſhe may be holy, both in Body and Spirit: But ſhe, that is Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, careth for the things of the World, how ſhe may pleaſe her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. And this I ſpeak for your own profit, not that I may caſt a Snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that you may attend upon the Lord without Diſtraction. But if any Man think, that he behaveth himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely toward his Virgin, if ſhe paſs the Flower of her Age, and need ſo require, let him do what he will, he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not: Let them Marry. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, he that ſtandeth ſtedfaſt in his Heart, having no Neceſſity, but hath Power over his own will, and hath ſo decreed in his Heart, that he will keep his Virgin, doth well. So then, he that giveth her in Marriage, doth well: but he, that giveth her not in Marriage, doth better, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 7. 1, 6,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:34034:66"/> 17, 25. I looked, and lo, a Lamb ſtood on the Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> and with him an hundred forty and four thouſand, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Father's Name written in their Foreheads.—And they ſung as it were a new Song before the Throne, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the four Beaſts, and the Elders: And no Man could learn that Song, but the hundred and forty and four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, which were redeemed from the Earth. Theſe are they, which were not defiled with Women; for they are Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins: Theſe are they, which follow the Lamb, whitherſoever he goeth: Theſe were redeemed from among Men, being the Firſt-fruits unto God, and to the Lamb. And in their Mouth was found no Guile: For they are without Fault before the Throne of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 1, 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus the Rule: In which theſe Particulars are declar'd:</hi> Firſt, <hi>That it is lawful and good to Marry; but that it is better to remain Unmarried:</hi> 2dly, <hi>That the Unmarried State has much the Advantage of the other, for tending upon the Lord with leſs Diſtraction.</hi> 3dly, <hi>That there are Perſons, which remain Unmarried</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XXII. Of Married Perſons, Husband and Wife.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> WHAT Directions do's the Goſpel give, as to the State of Marriage, and to thoſe, which are engag'd in it?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It ſpeaks very particularly upon this Subject, and what ought to be well conſider'd by all concern'd.</hi> Firſt, <hi>That it is not to be diſſolv'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Phariſees alſo came unto him, tempting him, and ſaying unto him: Is it lawful for a Man to put away his Wife for every Cauſe? And he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered and ſaid unto them; have you not read, that he which made them at the beginning, made them Male and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:34034:67"/> Female? And ſaid, for this Cauſe ſhall a Man leave Father and Mother, and ſhall cleave to his Wife, and they twain ſhall be one Fleſh. Wherefore they are no more twain, but one Fleſh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not Man put aſunder.<hi>—Moſes,</hi> becauſe of the Hardneſs of your Hearts, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered you to put away your Wives; but from the beginning it was not ſo. And I ſay unto you; whoſoever ſhall put away his Wife, except it be for Fornication, and ſhall Marry another, committeth Adultery; and whoſo marrieth her, which is put away, doth commit Adultery, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 3. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the Married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, let not the Wife depart from her Husband: But and if ſhe depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her Husband: And let not the Husband put away his Wife, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 10. The Woman, which hath an Husband, is bound by the Law to her Husband, ſo long as he liveth: But if the Husband be dead, ſhe is looſed from the Law of her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. So then, if while her Husband
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:34034:68"/> liveth, ſhe be Married to another Man, ſhe ſhall be called an Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs: But if her Husband be dead, ſhe is free from that Law; ſo that, ſhe is no Adultereſs, tho' ſhe be Married to another Man, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 2. The Wife is bound by the Law, as long as her Husband liveth: But if her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band he dead, ſhe is at Liberty to be Married to whom ſhe will; only in the Lord. But ſhe is happier, if ſhe ſo abide, after my Judgment: And I think alſo, that I have the Spirit of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 39.</p>
               <p>2dly, <hi>As to difference of Religion in Man and Wife, S.</hi> Paul <hi>thus gives his Judgment.</hi> To the reſt ſpeak I, not the Lord, if any Brother hath a Wife, that believeth not, and ſhe be pleaſed to dwell with him, let him not put her away. And the Woman, which hath an Husband, that believeth not, and if he be pleaſed to dwell with her, let her not leave him. For the unbelieving Husband is ſanctified by the Wife, and the unbelieving Wife is ſanctified by the Husband: Elſe were your Children unclean; but now they are holy. But
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:34034:68"/> if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A Brother or a Siſter is not under Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage in ſuch Caſes: But God hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led us to Peace. For what knoweſt thou, O Wife, whether thou ſhalt ſave thy Husband? Or how knoweſt thou, O Man, whether thou ſhalt ſave thy Wife? But as God hath diſtributed to every Man, as the Lord hath called every one, ſo let him walk: And ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain I in all the Churches, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 12.</p>
               <p>3dly, <hi>As to one part of their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Obligation:</hi> Let the Husband render unto the Wife due Benevolence: And likewiſe alſo the Wife unto the Husband. The Wife hath not Power of her own Body, but the Husband: And likewiſe alſo the Husband hath not Power of his own Body, but the Wife. Defraud you not one the other, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be with conſent for a Time, that ye may give your ſelves to Faſting and Prayer; and come together again, that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan tempt you not for your Incontinency. But I ſpeak this by Permiſſion, and not of Commandment, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 3.</p>
               <p>4thly, <hi>That they may and ought</hi>

                  <hi>to live holily:</hi> There was in the Days of <hi>Herod</hi> the King of <hi>Judea,</hi> a certain Prieſt, named <hi>Zacharias,</hi> of the Courſe of <hi>Abia:</hi> And his Wife was of the Daughters of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and her Name was <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> And they were both righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous before God, walking in all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments and Ordinances of the Lord, blameleſs, and they had no Child, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was barren, and they both were now well ſtricken in years, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 5. This I ſay, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, the time is ſhort. It remaineth, that both they, that have Wives, be as tho' they had none; and they that weep, as tho' they wept not; and they that rejoice, as tho' they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as tho' they poſſeſſed not; and they that uſe this World, as not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing it: For the faſhion of this World paſſeth away, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 29. We beſeech you, Brethren, and exhort you, by the Lord Jeſus, that as ye have received of us, how ye ought to walk, and to pleaſe God, ſo ye would abound more and more. For ye know, what Commandments we gave you by the Lord Jeſus. For this is the Will
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:34034:69"/> of God, even your Sanctification, that ye ſhould abſtain from Fornication: That every one of you ſhould know how to poſſeſs his Veſſel in Sanctification and Honor; not in the Luſt of Concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, even as the Gentiles, which know not God, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. 1. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is honorable in all, and the Bed undefiled: But Whoremongers and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterers God will judge. Let your Converſation be without Covetouſneſs: and be content with ſuch things, as ye have: For he hath ſaid, I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 4.</p>
               <p>5thly, <hi>That there are great Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of mutual Love and Support be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to them; and that Order is to be obſerv'd, which God has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed between them.</hi> I would have you know, that the Head of every Man is Chriſt; and the Head of the Woman is the Man; and the Head of Chriſt is God.—A Man indeed ought not to cover his Head, <hi>(praying)</hi> for as much as he is the Image and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God: But the Woman is the Glory of the Man. For the Man is not of the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:34034:70"/> Woman; but the Woman of the Man. Neither was the Man created for the Woman; but the Woman for the Man. For this Cauſe ought the Woman to have Power on her Head, becauſe of the Angels. Nevertheleſs, neither is the Man without the Woman, neither the Woman without the Man in the Lord. For as the Woman is of the Man, even ſo is the Man alſo by the Woman; but all things of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3, 7. Submitting your ſelves one to another in the Fear of God.</p>
               <p>Wives, ſubmit your ſelves unto your own Husbands as unto the Lord. For the Husband is the Head of the Wife, even as Chriſt is Head of the Church: And he is the Saviour of the Body. Therefore as the Church is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto Chriſt, ſo let the Wives be to their own Husbands in every thing.</p>
               <p>Husbands love your Wives even as Chriſt loved the Church, and alſo gave himſelf for it: That he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it.—So ought Men to love their Wives, as their own Bodies: He that loveth his Wife, loveth himſelf. For no Man ever yet hated his own Fleſh;
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:34034:70"/> but nouriſheth and cheriſheth it, even as the Lord the Church: For we are Members of his Body, of his Fleſh, and of his Bones. For this Cauſe ſhall a Man leave his Father and Mother, and ſhall be joined unto his Wife, and they two ſhall be one Fleſh. This is a great Myſtery: But I ſpeak concerning Chriſt and the Church. Nevertheleſs,</p>
               <p>Let every one of you in particular, ſo love his Wife, even as himſelf; and the Wife ſee, that ſhe reverence her Husband, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 21, 28.</p>
               <p>Wives ſubmit your ſelves unto your own Husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.</p>
               <p>Husbands, love your Wives, and be not bitter againſt them, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 18.</p>
               <p>Ye Wives, be in Subjection to your own Husbands; that if any obey not the word, they alſo may without the word be won by the Converſation of the Wives, while they behold your chaſte Converſation coupled with Fear. Whoſe adorning, let it not be that outward adorning, of plaiting the Hair, and of wearing of Gold, or of putting on of Apparel: but let it be the hidden Man of the Heart, in that, which is not
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:34034:71"/> corruptible, even the Ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit, which is in the Sight of God of great Price. For after this manner in the Old Time, the holy Women alſo, who truſted in God, adorned themſelves, being in Subjection unto their own Husbands, even as <hi>Sara</hi> obeyed <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> calling him Lord: Whoſe Daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not affraid with any A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 1.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe ye Husbands, dwell with them according to Knowledge, giving Honor unto the Wife, as unto the weaker Veſſel, and as being Heirs toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Grace of Life; that your Prayers be not hinder'd, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7.</p>
               <p>Teach the young Women to be ſober, to love their Husbands, to love their Children, to be Diſcreet, Chaſte, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers at Home, good, obedient to their own Husbands, that the Word of God be not blaſphemed, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 4.</p>
               <p>Young Men likewiſe exhort to be So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-minded, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 6.</p>
               <p>That the aged Men be Sober, Grave, Temperate, Sound in Faith, in Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in Patience, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 2.</p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:34034:71"/>
               <p> The aged Women likewiſe, that they be in Behavior, as becometh Holineſs, not falſe Accuſers, not given to much Wine, Teachers of good things, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 3.</p>
               <p>I will that Men pray every where, lifting up holy Hands, without Wrath and Doubting, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 8.</p>
               <p>In like manner alſo, that Women a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn themſelves in modeſt Apparel, with Shamefacedneſs and Sobriety: Not broider'd Hair, or Gold, or Pearls, or coſtly Array; but (which becometh Women profeſſing Godlineſs) with good Works. Let the Women learn in ſilence with all Subjection. But I ſuffer not a Woman to teach, nor to uſurp Authority over the Man, but to be in ſilence. For <hi>Adam</hi> was firſt formed, then <hi>Eve.</hi> And <hi>Adam</hi> was not deceived, but the Woman being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, was in the Tranſgreſſion. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſhe ſhall be ſaved in Child-bearing, if they continue in Faith, and Charity, and Holineſs with Sobriety, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 9.</p>
               <p>Let your Women keep ſilence in the Churches: For it is not permitted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them to ſpeak; but they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:34034:72"/> to be under Obedience, as alſo ſaith the Law. And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their Husbands at Home: For it is a Shame for Women to ſpeak in the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 34.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus ſpeaks the Rule, and ſo particularly, that there can be no need of repeating it. Let all then, who engage in this State, remember the Charge here given, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh themſelves from Heathens, by endeavoring to be punctual in it. The State is what God has or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd for the Propagation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and filling up the Number of the Elect. Thus it becomes ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to the Faithful, and ought to be undertaken, not in the Spirit of Brutes, or of the World, but in the Fear of God, and the Spirit of true Holineſs; ſo as to hope for the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of a manifold Grace, ſuch as may be neceſſary for ſatisfying all the Obligations belonging to their State. For a help in this, I wiſh they would often read, what the Word of God here ſpeaks to them, that ſo being</hi>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:34034:72"/> 
                  <hi>frequently reminded of their Duty, they may be ſolicitous, in comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with it. In undertaking this State, they have undertaken theſe Obligations; and if they are not careful in ſatisfying them, they are faithleſs and unjuſt; and what then will it avail them to be juſt in other Duties, if they are unjuſt in theſe, which are annext to their State? Cuſtom may ſeem to leſſen the Guilt; but this is a Snare for ſuch, as are willing to be deceiv'd; for certainly it cannot be a Leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but an Aggravation of Sin, to live always in it.</hi>

               <p>A. <hi>It ſpeaks very particularly of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was one <hi>Anna</hi> a Propheteſs, the Daughter of <hi>Phanuel,</hi> of the Tribe
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:34034:73"/> of <hi>Aſer;</hi> ſhe was of a great age, and had lived with an Husband ſeven Years from her Virginity. And ſhe was a Widow of about fourſcore and four Years; which departed not from the Temple, but ſerved God with Faſtings and Prayer Night and Day, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 36.</p>
               <p>I ſay to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nmarried and Widows, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> for them, if they abide, even as I. But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry, than to burn.—But, as God hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed to every Man, as the Lord hath called every one, ſo let him walk: and ſo ordain I in all the Churches, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 8, 17.</p>
               <p>The unmarried Woman careth for the things of the Lord, that ſhe may be holy both in Body and in Spirit: but ſhe, that is married, careth for the things of the World, how ſhe may pleaſe her Husband. And this I ſpeak for your own Profit, not that I may caſt a Snare upon you; but for that, which is comely, and that you may attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord without Diſtraction.—The Wife is bound by the Law, as long as
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:34034:73"/> her Husband liveth: but if her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band be dead, ſhe is at liberty to be married to whom ſhe will; only in the Lord. But ſhe is happier, if ſhe ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide, after my Judgment: and I think alſo, that I have the Spirit of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 34, 39.</p>
               <p>Honor Widows, that are Widows indeed. But if any Widow have Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren or Nephews, let them learn firſt to ſhew Piety at home, and to requite their Parents: for that is good and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table before God. Now ſhe, that is a Widow indeed, and deſolate, truſteth in God, and continueth in Supplications and Prayers night and day. But ſhe, that liveth in pleaſure, is dead, while ſhe liveth. And theſe things give in charge, that they may be blameleſs. But if any provide not for his own, and eſpecially for thoſe of his own Houſe, he hath denied the Faith, and is worſe than an Infidel. Let not a Widow be taken into the number, under Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore Years old, having been the Wife of one Man, well reported of for good Works; if ſhe have brought up Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, if ſhe have lodged Strangers, if
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:34034:74"/> ſhe have waſhed the Saints Feet, if ſhe have relieved the Afflicted, if ſhe have diligently followed every good Work. But the younger Widows refuſe: for when they have begun to wax wanton againſt Chriſt, they will marry, having Damnation, becauſe they have caſt off their firſt Faith. And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from Houſe to Houſe; and not only idle, but Tattlers alſo, and Buſie-bodies, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things, which they ought not. I will therefore that the younger Women marry, bear Children, guide the Houſe, give none Occaſion to the Adverſary to ſpeak reproachfully, for ſome are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy turned aſide after Satan. If any Man or Woman, that believeth, have Widows, let them relieve them, and let not the Church be charged; that it may relieve them, that are Widows indeed, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus ſpeaks the Rule to Perſons of this State, plainly ſhewing, what are the Advantages to be made of it, and what the Exerciſes, by which they may recommend themſelves to the Favor of Heaven. Such then, as</hi>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:34034:74"/> 
                  <hi>deſire the Comforts of his Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who reckons Widows a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular part of his Care, may here ſee how they may be of this number, ſince they have him for their Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, who offers his Help. Thus then they may be Happy, and even Gainers by their Loſs, in the tender Offers of a Heavenly Father. But if they look not for this Privilege; but ſtill have their Hearts full of the World, and ſtill follow its Ways, they have the Name of Widows, but are not Widows indeed; they ſeek Earthly Comforts, and ſuch they may have.</hi>

Are ye able to drink of the Cup, that I ſhall drink of? <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 20. <hi>Ambition is to be avoided in the diſpoſing of Children, and in ſeeking Preferment for them: Due Care is to be us'd, in teaching them to do the Will of God, and embrace his Appointments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Days of her Purification, according to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> were accompliſhed, they brought him <hi>(the Infant Jeſus)</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to preſent him to the Lord, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 22. <hi>A good Practice of Parents to offer their Children daily to God, for obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Grace and Protection upon them.</hi>

               <p>And they ſought him among their Kinsfolk and Acquaintance. And when
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:34034:75"/> they found him not, they turned back again to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſeeking him, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 44. <hi>It is the Parents Care, to ſeek their Children, and to omit no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry in regaining them, when they are loſt.

               <p>He aroſe, and came to his Father. But when he was yet a great way off, his Father ſaw him, and had Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ran, and fell on his Neck, and kiſſed him. And the Son ſaid unto him, Father, I have ſinned againſt Heaven, and in thy Sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son. But the Father ſaid to his Servants, Bring forth the beſt Robe, and put it on him, and put a Ring on his Hand, and Shooes on his Feet; and bring hither the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Calf, and kill it; and let us eat and be merry: For this my Son was dead, and is alive again; he was loſt, and is found, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 20. <hi>Parents are to receive their Children with Tenderneſs and Love, when they return from their ill Ways.</hi>

               <p> Ye Fathers, provoke not your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to Wrath: but bring them up in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 4.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theſe are ſome principal Duties belonging to Parents; which, if duly obſerv'd, will bring Peace of Conſcience, and cannot fail of good Effects. But however, in this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Concern, it cannot be amiſs to add ſomething out of the Old-Teſtament.</hi>

                  <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid unto his eldeſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of his Houſe, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy Hand under my Thigh, and I will make thee ſwear by the Lord, the God of Heaven, and the God of the Earth, that thou ſhalt not take a Wife unto my Son of the Daughters of the Canaanites, amongſt whom I dwell: but thou

               </p>
               <p>And his Sons went and feaſted in their Houſes, every one his Day, and ſent and called for their three Siſters, to eat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to drink with them.

               <p>A. <hi>Yes, there are ſuch.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:34034:84"/>
               <p> Behold, one came and ſaid unto him, Good Maſter, what good thing ſhall I do, that I may have eternal Life? And he ſaid unto him, why calleſt thou me Good? There is none Good, but one, that is, God: But if thou wilt enter into Life, keep the Commandments. He ſaith unto him, which? Jeſus ſaid, Thou ſhalt do no Murther, Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery, Thou ſhalt not Steal, Thou ſhalt not bear falſe Witneſs, Honor thy Father and thy Mother; and, thou ſhalt love thy Neighbor as thy ſelf. The young Man ſaith unto him, all theſe things have I kept from my Youth up: What lack I yet? Jeſus ſaid unto him, if thou wilt be perfect, go and Sell what thou haſt, and give to the Poor, and thou ſhalt have Treaſure in Heaven; and come and follow me. But when the Young Man heard that Saying, he went away Sorrowful; for he had great Poſſeſſions, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 16. <hi>The Commandments are to be kept by all Perſons in their Youth; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven then they are to conſider which</hi>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:34034:84"/> 
                  <hi>is the Way to eternal Life, and whether they walk in it, and what is yet wanting to them. It is ſaid of this Young Man, that</hi> Jeſus, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding him, loved him, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10. 21. <hi>And thus only can Youth expect the Love of Jeſus. If this be true; then what is the unhappy State of thoſe great Numbers, who have their Thoughts, Deſires, Affections, ſo confin'd to Self-love, and the Love of the World, that they ſcarce think of another Life! Grant them, O God, a better Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Child grew, and waxed ſtrong in Spirit, filled with Wiſdom; and the Grace of God was upon him.—And when he was twelve years Old, they went up to <hi>Jeruſalem—</hi>after three Days they found him in the Temple, ſitting in the midſt of the Doctors, both bearing them, and asking them queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 40, 42, 46.

               <p>The Way of the Wicked is an Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination unto the Lord, but he loveth him, that followeth after Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 9. A Scorner loveth not one, that reproveth him; neither will he go unto the Wiſe, <hi>v.</hi> 12. The

               <p>A Reproof entereth more into a wiſe Man, than an hundred Stripes into a Fool, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17. 10.

               <p>The Diſcretion of a Man differeth his Anger, and it is his Glory to paſs over a Tranſgreſſion, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 11. Slothfulneſs caſteth into a deep Sleep; and an Idle Soul ſhall ſuffer Hunger, 15. He, that hath pity upon the Poor, lendeth unto the Lord; and that, which he hath given, will he pay him again, 17. Hear Counſel, and receive Inſtruction, that thou mayeſt be wiſe in thy latter End, 20. Reprove one, that hath <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, and he will underſtand Knowledge, 25.</p>

               <p> An high Look, and a proud Heart, and the plowing of the Wicked is Sin, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 4. He, that loveth Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſhall be a poor Man, 17.</p>
               <p>The Mouth of a ſtrange Women is a deep Pit; he, that is abhorred of the Lord, ſhall fall therein, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. 14.</p>
               <p>Hear thou my Son, and be wiſe, and guide thine Heart in the Way. Be not amongſt Wine-bibbers; amongſt Rioters, Eaters of Fleſh: For the Drunkard and the Glutton ſhall come to Poverty: and Drowſineſs ſhall Cloath a Man with Rags, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 19. Who hath Wo?

They that tarry long at the Wine;—at the laſt it biteth like a Serpent, and ſtingeth like an Adder. Thine Eyes ſhall behold ſtrange Women, and thine Heart ſhall utter perverſe Things. Yea, thou ſhalt be as he, that lyeth down in the midſt of the Sea, or as he, that lyeth upon the top of a Maſt, 23, 29.</p>

               <p> Rejoice, O young Man, in thy Youth, and let thy Heart cheer thee in the Days of thy Youth, and walk in the Ways of thy Heart, and in the Sight of thine Eyes: But know thou, that for all theſe things God will bring thee unto Judgment.—Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and Youth are Vanity, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 11. 9.</p>
               <p>Remember now thy Creator in the Days of thy Youth, while the evil Days come not, nor the Years draw nigh, when thou ſhalt ſay, I have no Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in them, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12. 1.</p>

                  <hi>Theſe are Inſtructions given by the Spirit of God, and particularly directed to Youth; which, if fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, will lead to true Wiſdom; but, if neglected, the Fruit muſt be Deſtruction. The Difficulties of youthful Years are generally very great; for when the Strength of Paſſions carries them on, and there is neither Experience or Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to Stem the Violence of them, they run as naturally into Miſchief, as a Boat adrift down the Stream.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> WHAT Directions do's the Goſpel give to Chriſtians of this State?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It ſpeaks directly to them, and in ſuch a manner, that it is their great Concern to know and remember it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Who then is a faithful and wiſe Servant, whom his Lord hath made Ruler over his Houſhold, to give them Meat in due Seaſon? Bleſſed is that Servant, whom his Lord, when he cometh, ſhall find ſo doing. Verily, I ſay unto you, that he ſhall make him Ruler over all his Goods. But and if that evil Servant ſhall ſay in his Heart, My Lord delayeth his Coming, and ſhall begin to ſmite his Fellow-ſervants, and to eat and drink with the Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: The Lord of that Servant ſhall come in a Day, when he looketh not for him, and in an Hour, that he is not ware of; and ſhall cut him aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and appoint him his Portion with
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:34034:94"/> the Hypocrites: There ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 45. <hi>Fidelity, Prudence and Moderation, is here commended to Servants; and their Guilt is here declar'd, who are Imperious over their Fellow-ſervants, deal harſhly with them, or waſt what belongs to thoſe, whom they ſerve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well done, thou good and faithful ſervant, thou haſt been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.—And caſt ye the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable ſervant into outer darkneſs: There ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth, Mat. 25. 21, 30. <hi>A Reward is here promis'd to the faithful and induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Servant, who is truly Zealous in his Maſter's Intereſt: And Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment declar'd againſt the Slothful and Faithleſs, who are not Solicitous for their Maſter's Advantage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Bleſſed are thoſe ſervants, whom the Lord, when he cometh, ſhall find watching, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 37. <hi>Their Fidelity is rewarded, who, in the Maſter's Abſence, are Solicitous to diſcharge their Duty well.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:34034:94"/>
               <p> That ſervant, which knew his Lord's will, and prepared not himſelf, neither did according to his will, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes. But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of ſtripes, ſhall be beaten with few ſtripes. For unto whomſoever much is given, of him ſhall be much requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and to whom Men have committed much, of him they will ask the more, Luk. 12. 47. <hi>The Servant's Rule is the Will of the Maſter in all, that is not Sin. He is the beſt Servant, who not only do's according to his Maſter's Orders, but alſo according to his Deſires. But he, that knows his Maſter's Will, and yet do's it not, is not true to what he has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am reſolv'd what to do, that when I am put out of the Stewardſhip, they may receive me into their houſes, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 4. <hi>So ſaid this Steward, and accordingly, rais'd himſelf Friends at his Maſter's Coſt: But this being the unjuſt Steward, it is a thing, which Servants are not to imitate, but avoid as an Injuſtice.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:34034:95"/>
               <p> He, that is faithful in that, which is leaſt, is faithful alſo in much: And he, that is unjuſt in the leaſt, is unjuſt alſo in much, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 10. <hi>To be Faithful in little things is an Argument of true Fidelity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Servants, be obedient to them, that are your Maſters according to the fleſh, with Fear and Trembling, in ſingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your heart; as unto Chriſt: Not with eye-ſervice, as Men-pleaſers, but as the ſervants of Chriſt, doing the will of God from the heart; with good will doing ſervice, as to the Lord, and not to Men: Knowing, that whatſoever good thing, any Man do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, the ſame ſhall he receive of the Lord, whether he be Bond or Free, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 5. Servants, obey in all things your Maſters according to the fleſh; not with eye-ſervice, as Men-pleaſers, but in ſingleneſs of heart, fearing God: And whatſoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto Men; knowing, that of the Lord ye ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the reward of the inheritance: For ye ſerve the Lord Chriſt. But he, that doeth wrong, ſhall receive for
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:34034:95"/> the wrong, which he hath done: And there is no reſpect of Perſons, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 22. <hi>This Leſſon thus repeated by S.</hi> Paul, <hi>ought to be conſidered Word by Word; if it were read every Day by Servants, this would not be too often.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let as many ſervants, as are under the yoke, count their own Maſters wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all honor, that the Name of God and his Doctrin be not blaſphemed. And they, that have believing Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, let them not deſpiſe them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are brethren; but rather do them ſervice, becauſe they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 1.</p>
               <p>Exhort ſervants to be obedient unto their own Maſters, and to pleaſe them well in all things; not anſwering again; not purloining, but ſhewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrin of God our Saviour in all things, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 9.</p>
               <p>Servants, be ſubject to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters with all Fear, not only to the Good and Gentle, but alſo to the Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. For this is thank-worthy, if a
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:34034:96"/> Man for Conſcience toward God endure grief; ſuffering wrongfully. For what glory is it, if when ye be buffet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for your faults, ye ſhall take it patiently? But, if when ye do well, and ſuffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God. For even hereunto were ye called: Becauſe Chriſt alſo ſuffered for us, leaving us an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, that ye ſhould follow his ſteps; who did no ſin, neither was guile found in his mouth: Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he ſuffered, he threatned not; but committed himſelf to him, that judgeth righteouſly, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus ſpeaks the Rule, both to the Inſtruction and Comfort of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: It requires them to be Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Faithful in their Duty, not with Eye-ſervice, but as ſerving God, is always Preſent, and Witneſs whether of their Fidelity or Sloth. It requires them to give Reſpect and be Obedient to their Maſters, and this not only if they are Gentle and Mild, but even if they are Froward and Uneaſie. It requires them to</hi>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:34034:96"/> 
                  <hi>ſuffer with Patience, not only the Labor of their State, but likewiſe all Trials, as are frequent in their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, ſuch as are Reproofs, Reproaches, or even Blows; and theſe, not only, when they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, by their Faults, but even when they have done well, and therefore deſerv'd them not. For their Encouragement, the Apoſtle lays before them the Example of Chriſt; and lets them know, that God is not a Reſpecter of Perſons, and therefore, that if they ſerve faithfully, as to the Lord, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer patiently, according to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Chriſt, they may confide in God, as their faithful Rewarder. Such, as do thus, are Chriſtian Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and in as good a Way of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Great in the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as thoſe, whom they ſerve. But then, if they follow not this Advice, are Eye-ſervants, are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Careful in what they are to do, nor Patient in what they ſuffer, how unhappy are they! A kind of</hi>

                  <hi>I here add ſomething out of the Old Teſtament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ye ſhall do no unrighteouſneſs in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in Mete-yard, in VVeight or in Meaſure. Juſt Ballances, juſt VVeights, a juſt Ephah, and a juſt Hin ſhall ye have, I am the Lord your God.—There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall ye obſerve all my Statutes, and all my Judgments, and do them; I am the Lord, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 35.</p>
               <p>Thou ſhalt not have in thy Bag divers VVeights, a great and a ſmall. Thou
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:34034:99"/> ſhalt not have in thine Houſe divers Meaſures, a great and a ſmall. But thou ſhalt have a perfect and juſt weight, a perfect and juſt meaſure ſhalt thou have: That thy Days may be lengthened in the Land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee. For all, that do ſuch things, and all that do unrighteouſly, are an Abomination unto the Lord thy God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 25. 13.</p>
               <p>A falſe Ballance is Abomination to the Lord: But a juſt VVeight is his Delight, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11. 1. He, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth Corn, the People ſhall Curſe him: But Bleſſing ſhall be upon the Head of him, that ſelleth it, <hi>v.</hi> 26.</p>
               <p>Divers weights, and divers mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, both of them are alike Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Lord, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 10.</p>
               <p>Hear this, O ye, that ſwallow up the Needy, even to make the Poor of the Land to fail; ſaying, when will the new Moon be gone, that we may ſell Corn, and the Sabbath, that we may ſet forth VVheat, making the Ephah ſmall, and the Sheckel great, and falſifying the Ballances by Deceit? That we may buy the Poor for Silver,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:34034:99"/> and the Needy for a pair of Shoes, yea, and ſell the Refuſe of the VVheat? The Lord hath ſworn by the excellency of <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſurely I will never forget any of their works. Shall not the Land tremble for this, and every one mourn, that dwelleth therein? <hi>Amos</hi> 8. 4.</p>
               <p>The Lord's Voice crieth unto the City, and the Men of VViſdom ſhall ſee thy Name; hear ye the Rod, and who hath appointed it. Are there yet the Treaſures of Wickedneſs in the Houſe of the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the ſcant meaſure, that is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable? Shall I count them pure with the wicked Ballances, and with the Bag of deceitful VVeights? For the rich Men thereof are full of Violence, and the Inhabitants thereof have ſpoken Lies, and their Tongue is deceitful in their Mouth. Therefore alſo will I make thee Sick in ſmiting thee, in making thee deſolate, becauſe of thy Sins, <hi>Mic.</hi> 6. 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus ſpeaks the Rule, and in ſuch plain and poſitive Terms has God here manifeſted his Will, that there can be no doubt in ſuch, as deſire to follow it. He expreſly forbids all</hi>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:34034:100"/> 
                  <hi>kind of Fraud, or Over-reaching, or doing any Wrong to our Neighbor in buying or ſelling. He expreſly forbids all kinds of falſe Weights and Meaſures. He expreſly forbids all ſuch Monopoly, as raiſes the price of Neceſſaries, and oppreſſes the Poor. He expreſly forbids all kinds of Lying and Covetouſneſs. Thoſe, who in earneſt hope for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of God, muſt be Solicitous to do his Will; and ſince he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf has declar'd, that thoſe, who do otherwiſe in theſe Particulars, do what is an Abomination to him, they cannot doubt of their being in an ill Way, even in the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God. Now examin the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Practice of Chriſtians in all manner of Dealing with one another, and thence gueſs, whether God has Forbid all Fraud and Over-reaching amongſt them: And if he has, whether they believe him, or have any regard to his Precepts.</hi>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> WHAT Directions do's the Goſpel give to Perſons in this Station?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>There are ſeveral Particulars proper for their Inſtruction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the chief Prieſts and Elders, and all the Counſel ſought falſe witneſs againſt Jeſus, to put him to Death, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 59. Then the High-prieſt rent his Cloaths, ſaying, He hath ſpoken Blaſphemy, what farther need have we of witneſſes? Behold, now ye have heard his Blaſphemy, What think ye? <hi>v.</hi> 65. <hi>Innocence is not to be oppreſs'd by Calumny or falſe Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes; neither is</hi> Caiphas <hi>to be imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, who, being Judge, made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Party.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The chief Prieſts and Elders per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the Multitude, that they ſhould ask <hi>Barabbas,</hi> and deſtroy Jeſus,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:34034:101"/> 
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 20. When <hi>Pilate</hi> ſaw, that he could prevail nothing, but that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a tumult was made, he took Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and waſhed his Hands before the Multitude, ſaying, I am Innocent of the Blood of this juſt Perſon: See ye to it.—Then releaſed he <hi>Barabbas</hi> unto them: And when he had ſcourged Jeſus, he delivered him to be crucified, <hi>v.</hi> 24, 26. <hi>No Party to be made againſt the Innocent. Paſſion and Violence car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry away the Multitude to Injuſtice. The Innocent is not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd in compliance with them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then cried they all again, ſaying, not this Man, but <hi>Barabbas.</hi> Now <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabbas</hi> was a Robber. <hi>Jo.</hi> 18. 40. <hi>The Multitude blinded with Paſſion. Their Affection or Judgment is no direction for doing Juſtice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Jeſus anſwered, thou couldeſt have no Power at all againſt me, except it were given thee from above, <hi>Jo.</hi> 19. 11. <hi>The Power of Judges is from God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From thenceforth <hi>Pilate</hi> ſought to releaſe him: But the <hi>Jews</hi> cried out, ſaying, if thou let this Man go, thou art not <hi>Ceſar's</hi> Friend: Whoſoever
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:34034:101"/> maketh himſelf a King, ſpeaketh againſt <hi>Ceſar.</hi> When <hi>Pilate</hi> therefore heard that Saying, he brought Jeſus forth.—Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified, <hi>Jo.</hi> 19. 12. <hi>To condemn the Innocent for fear of diſpleaſing the Prince, is not Juſt, but a Weakneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was in a City a Judge, which feared not God, neither regarded Men. And there was a Widow in that City, and ſhe came unto him, ſaying, Avenge me of mine Adverſary; and he would not for a while, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 2. <hi>To neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the Cauſe of the Widow, is part of his Character, who fear'd not God, nor regarded Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One of the Company ſaid unto him, Maſter, ſpeak to my Brother, that he divide the Inheritance with me. And he ſaid unto him, Man, who made me a Judge or a Divider over you? <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 13. <hi>The Commiſſion or Power is not to be exceeded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid unto him <hi>(the High-prieſt)</hi> God ſhall ſmite thee, thou whited Wall: For ſitteſt thou to judge me after the Law, and commandeſt me
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:34034:102"/> to be ſmitten contrary to the Law? And they, that ſtood by, ſaid, revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt thou God's High-prieſt? Then ſaid <hi>Paul,</hi> I wiſt not, Brethren, that he was the High-prieſt: For it is written, thou ſhalt not ſpeak evil of the Ruler of thy People, <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 3. <hi>Magiſtrates not to be revil'd, even when they act contrary to Juſtice. No Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment juſt before Sentence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have found this Man a peſtilent Fellow, and a mover of Sedition among all the <hi>Jews</hi> throughout the World, and a ring-leader of the Sect of the <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renes:</hi> Who alſo hath gone about to profane the Temple: Whom we took, and would have judged according to Law.—And the <hi>Jews</hi> alſo aſſented, ſaying, that theſe things were ſo. Then <hi>Paul,</hi> after that the Governor had beckened unto him to ſpeak, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 5. <hi>A ſevere Charge is drawn up againſt Innocence, when Malice or falſe Zeal influence the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers. But a juſt Judge is not made a Party, but hears with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and judges according to Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:34034:102"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Felix</hi> trembled and anſwered, Go thy Way for this time, when I have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Seaſon, I will call for thee. He hoped alſo, that Money ſhould have been given him of <hi>Paul,</hi> that he might looſe him: Wherefore he ſent for him the oftner, and communed with him. But after two years, <hi>Porcius Feſtus</hi> came into <hi>Felix</hi> room: And <hi>Felix</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſhew the <hi>Jews</hi> a pleaſure, left <hi>Paul</hi> bound, <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 25. <hi>To prolong a Cauſe for Intereſt, is not juſt; to wait for Money, where Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence pleads for a Diſcharge, is not juſt: To gratifie a People by the Oppreſſion of Innocence, is not juſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Felix</hi> heard theſe things <hi>(the Plea made by the Apoſtle)</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving more perfect Knowledge of that Way, he deferred them, <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 22. <hi>The Clamor and Violence of Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers prevail nothing with a Judge, who has a true Knowledge of the Cauſe: He will not let an ill Name be enough for puniſhing the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous Judgment, <hi>Jo.</hi> 7. 24.</p>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:34034:103"/>
               <p> Do ye not know, that the Saints ſhall judge the World? And if the World ſhall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the ſmalleſt matters? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 2. <hi>Holineſs an excellent Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for judging according to Juſtice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Gallio</hi> was Deputy of <hi>Achaia,</hi> the Jews made Inſurrection with one accord againſt <hi>Paul,</hi> and brought him to the Judgment-ſeat, ſaying, This Fellow perſwadeth Men to worſhip God contrary to the Law. And when <hi>Paul</hi> was now about to open his Mouth, <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio</hi> ſaid unto the Jews, If it were a matter of Wrong, or wicked Lewdneſs, O ye Jews, reaſon would, that I ſhould bear with you: But if it be a queſtion of Words and Names, and of your Law, look ye to it, for I will be no Judge of ſuch Matters. And he drove them from the Judgment-ſeat, <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 12. <hi>Violence brings ſome to the Barr, who are no Criminals; the Juſtice of the Bench is to diſtinguiſh. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Law, is in ſome Caſes to be in the right. The Bench judges not of Cauſes, which belong to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Court.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:34034:103"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Something may be here inſerted out of the Old Teſtament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Moſes</hi> Father in-law, ſaw all that he did to the People, he ſaid, what is this thing, that thou doeſt to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? Why ſitteſt thou thy ſelf alone, and all the People ſtand by thee from Morning unto Even? <hi>Exod.</hi> 18. 14. <hi>To make the People wait one Day is here reproved; what would have been the Cenſure of Cauſes delay'd, with endleſs Expence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thou ſhalt provide out of all the People, able Men, ſuch as fear God, Men of Truth, hating Covetouſneſs, and place ſuch over them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18. 21. <hi>Good Directions for the Choice of Magiſtrates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thou ſhalt not raiſe <hi>(or receive)</hi> a falſe Report: Put not thine Hand with the Wicked to be an unrighteous Witneſs. Thou ſhalt not follow a Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, to do Evil: Neither ſhalt thou ſpeak in a Cauſe, to incline after many, to wreſt Judgment. Neither ſhalt thou countenance a poor Man in his Cauſe.—Thou ſhalt not wreſt the Judgment of thy Poor in his Cauſe. Keep thee far from
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:34034:104"/> a falſe Matter; and the Innocent and Righteous ſlay thou not: For I will not juſtifie the Wicked. And thou ſhalt take no Gift; for the Gift blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Wiſe, and perverteth the Words of the Righteous. Alſo thou ſhalt not oppreſs a Stranger, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 1, 6.</p>
               <p>Ye ſhall do no unrighteouſneſs in Judgment; thou ſhalt not reſpect the Perſon of the Poor, nor honor the Perſon of the Mighty: But in Righteouſneſs ſhalt thou judge thy Neighbor, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 15.</p>
               <p>I charged your Judges at that time, ſaying, hear the Cauſes between your Brethren, and judge righteouſly between every Man and his Brother, and the Stranger, that is with him. Ye ſhall not reſpect Perſons in Judgment, but you ſhall hear the Small, as well as the Great; you ſhall not be affraid of the Face of Man, for the Judgment is God's, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 16.</p>
               <p>Judges and Officers ſhalt thou make thee in all thy Gates, which the Lord thy God giveth thee, throughout the Tribes; and they ſhall judge the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with juſt Judgment. Thou ſhalt
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:34034:104"/> not wreſt Judgment, thou ſhalt reſpect Perſons, neither take a Gift: For a Gift doth blind the Eyes of the Wiſe, and pervert the Words of the Righteous. That which is altogether Juſt, ſhalt thou follow, that thou mayeſt live and inherit the Land, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 18.</p>
               <p>One VVitneſs ſhall not riſe up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Man, for any Iniquity, or for any Sin, in any Sin, that he ſinneth: At the mouth of two VVitneſſes, or at the mouth of three VVitneſſes ſhall the matter be eſtabliſhed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. 15.</p>
               <p>If there be a Controverſie between Men, and they come unto Judgment, that the Judges may judge them, then they ſhall juſtifie the Righteous, and condemn the VVicked, <hi>Deut.</hi> 25. 1.</p>
               <p>Curſed be he, that perverteth the Judgment of the Stranger, Fatherleſs and VVidow: And all the People ſhall ſay, <hi>Amen.</hi> Curſed be he, that taketh reward, to ſlay an innocent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Deut. 27. 19, 25.</p>
               <p>And it came to paſs, when <hi>Samuel</hi> was Old, that he made his Sons Judges over <hi>Iſrael.—</hi>And his Sons walked not in his VVays, but turned
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:34034:105"/> aſide after Lucre, and took Bribes, and perſwaded Judgment, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 1, 3.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid unto all <hi>Iſrael,—</hi>Behold, here I am, VVitneſs againſt me before the Lord, and before his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed: VVhoſe Ox have I taken? Or whoſe Aſs have I taken? Or whom have I defrauded? VVhom have I op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed? Or of whoſe Hand have I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any Bribe to blind mine Eyes therewith? And I will reſtore it. And they ſaid, thou haſt not defraud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, nor oppreſſed us, neither haſt thou taken ought of any Man's Hand, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 1, 3.</p>
               <p>And he <hi>(Jehoſhaphat)</hi> ſet Judges in the Land, throughout all the fenced Cities of <hi>Judah,</hi> City by City; and he ſaid to the Judges, take heed what ye do; for ye judge not for Man, but for the Lord, who is with you in the Judgment. VVherefore now let the Fear of the Lord be upon you, take heed and do it: For there is no Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity with the Lord our God, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Perſons, nor taking of Gifts.—And he charged them, ſaying, thus
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:34034:105"/> ſhall ye do in the fear of the Lord, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and with a perfect Heart.—Deal courageouſly, and the Lord ſhall be with the Good, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 5, 9, 11.</p>
               <p>VVhoſo rewardeth Evil for Good, Evil ſhall not depart from his Houſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17. 13. He, that juſtifieth the Wicked, and he, that condemneth the Juſt; even they both are Abomination to the Lord, <hi>v.</hi> 15. A wicked Man ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a Gift out of the Boſom, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Ways of Judgment, <hi>v.</hi> 23.</p>
               <p>Rob not the poor, becauſe he is poor: Neither oppreſs the afflicted in the Gate. For the Lord will plead their Cauſe, and ſpoil the Soul of thoſe, that ſpoiled them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. 22.</p>
               <p>To have reſpect of Perſons, is not good: For, for a piece of Bread, that Man will tranſgreſs, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 21.</p>
               <p>Learn to do Well, ſeek Judgment, relieve the Oppreſſed, judge the Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, plead for the Widow, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 17.</p>
               <p>How is the faithful City become an Harlot! It was full of Judgment, Righteouſneſs lodged in it; but now Murtherers.—Thy Princes are Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and Companions of Thieves: Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:34034:106"/> one loveth Gifts, and followeth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Rewards: They judge not the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs, neither doth the Cauſe of the Widow come unto them. Therefore ſaith the Lord—I will turn my Hand upon thee, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 21.</p>
               <p>Wo unto them, that call evil good, and good evil:—VVhich juſtifie the VVicked for Reward, and take away the Righteouſneſs of the Righteous from him:—Becauſe they have caſt away the Law of the Lord of Hoſts,—there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the Anger of the Lord kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled againſt his People, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. 20, 23.</p>
               <p>VVo unto them, that decree unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Decrees, and that write Grievouſneſs, which they have preſcribed: To turn aſide the Needy from Judgment, and to take away the Right from the Poor of my People, that Widows may be their prey, and that they may rob the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs. And what will you do in the Day of Viſitation, and in the Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, which ſhall come? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10. 1.</p>
               <p>I know your manifold Tranſgreſſions, and your mighty Sins: They afflict the Juſt, they take a Bribe, and they turn aſide tbe Poor in the Gate from their
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:34034:106"/> Right.—Hate the Evil, and love the Good, and eſtabliſh Judgment in the Gate: It may be, that the Lord of Hoſts will be gracious unto the Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of <hi>Joſeph, Amos</hi> 5. 12.</p>
               <p>The Good Man is periſhed out of the Earth: And there is none <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men: They all lye in wait for Blood: They hunt every Man his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a Net. That they may do Evil with both Hands earneſtly; the Prince asketh, and the Judge asketh for a Reward: And the great Man he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth his miſchievous Deſire, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 2.</p>
               <p>Why doſt thou ſhew me Iniquity, and cauſe me to behold Grievance: For Spoiling and Violence are before me, and there are, that raiſe up Strife and Contention. Therefore the Law is ſlacked, and Judgment doth never go forth: For the Wicked doth compaſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Righteous: Therefore wrong Judgment proceedeth. Behold ye among the Heathen, and regard, and wonder marvelouſly; for I will work a Work in your Days, which ye will not believe, tho' it be told you, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1. 3.</p>

               <p> Theſe are the things, that ye ſhall do; ſpeak ye every Man the Truth to his Neighbor: Execute the Judgment of Truth and Peace in your Gates. And let none of you imagin evil in your Hearts againſt his Neighbor, and love no falſe Oath, for all theſe are things, that I hate, ſaith the Lord, <hi>Zech.</hi> 8. 16.</p>

               <p> And they called them, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them not to ſpeak at all, nor teach in the Name of Jeſus.

               <p>Let every Soul be ſubject unto the higher Powers; for there is no Power, but of God: The Powers, that be, are ordained of God. Whoſoever therefore reſiſteth the Power, reſiſteth the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God: And they, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, ſhall receive to themſelves Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For Rulers are not a Terror to good Works, but to the Evil. Wilt thou then not he affraid of the Power? Do that which is good, and thou ſhalt have praiſe of the ſame: For he is the Miniſter of God to thee for good. But if thou do that, which is evil, be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, for he beareth not the Sword in

Wherefore, ye muſt needs be ſubject, not only for Wrath, but alſo for Conſcience ſake.

For ſo is the Will of God, that with well-doing ye may put to ſilence the Ignorance of Fooliſh Men: As free, and not uſing your Liberty for a Cloak of Maliciouſneſs, but as the Servants of God.

               <head>CHAP. XXXII. Of Perſons of Quality.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> ARE there any Directions in the Goſpel for Perſons of this Rank?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Some Inſtructions there are, which it may not be improper for theſe to conſider, which I will ſet down here; but they being likewiſe concern'd in the next Chapter, I muſt recommend that to their peruſal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ye ſee your Calling, Brethren, how that not many wiſe men after the Fleſh, not many mighty, not many noble, are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. But God hath choſen the fooliſh things of the World, to confound the wiſe, and God hath choſen the weak things of the World, to confound the things, which are mighty; and baſe things of the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:34034:112"/> World, and things, which are deſpiſed, hath God choſen, yea, and things, which are not, to bring to nought things that are: That no Fleſh ſhould glory in his preſence. But of him are ye in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God is made unto us Wiſdom, and Righteouſneſs, and Sanctification, and Redemption: That, according as it is written, he that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth, let him glory in the Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 26. <hi>God makes not choice of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from their Greatneſs, Wiſdom or Nobility; he choſe the contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible things of this World, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found all Confidence and Glory, except that, which is in God alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Brethren, have not the Faith of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Lord of Glory, with reſpect of Perſons. For if there come unto your Aſſembly a Man with a gold Ring, in goodly Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, and there come in alſo a poor Man in vile Raiment; and ye have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to him, that weareth the gay Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſay unto him, ſit thou here in a good place; and ſay to the Poor, ſtand thou there, or ſit here under my Footſtool: Are ye not then Partial in
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:34034:112"/> your ſelves, and are become Judges of evil Thoughts? Hearken, my beloved Brethren, hath not God choſen the Poor of this World rich in Faith, and Heirs of the Kingdom, which he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to them, that love him? But ye have deſpiſed the Poor. Do not rich Men oppreſs you, and draw you before the Judgment-ſeats? Do not they blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme the worthy Name, by the which ye are called? <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>To be Partial in the Reſpect of Perſons, the Spirit of God diſapproves. Humane Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs has no Preference with God. To be Honorable, in the Goſpel-ſcheme, is to do that, which the Goſpel moſt recommends, and for which a Soul ſhall find Honor with God. They, who do this, are truly Honorable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Some additions may be here made out of the Old Teſtament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> went out, whitherſoever <hi>Saul</hi> ſent him, and behaved himſelf wiſely, 1 Sam. 18. 5. <hi>A vertuous and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Conduct is a ſure Step to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor; this cannot fail of being va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued. But great Titles, Retinue and Riches join'd with a light Head and</hi>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:34034:113"/> 
                  <hi>Indiſcretion, help to make a Perſon more remarkably Contemptible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King <hi>(David)</hi> ſaid; and where is thy Maſter's Son? And <hi>Ziba</hi> ſaid unto the King, behold, he abideth at <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> For he ſaid, to Day ſhall the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> reſtore me the Kingdom of my Father. Then ſaid the King to <hi>Ziba,</hi> behold, thine are all that pertained unto <hi>Mephibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth,</hi> 2 Sam. 16. 3. <hi>A Servant thus made his Court to the King, by falſly accuſing his Maſter, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracing him with his Prince. Such a Step to Honor is baſe, only fit for a treacherous Servant; and cannot be attempted without Infamy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Barzillai</hi> ſaid unto the King, how long have I to live, that I ſhould go up with the King unto <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 34. <hi>To retire from Court and public Buſineſs, for making a Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for Death, is Chriſtian Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. Solicitude of Buſineſs and Variety of Engagements are not a Help for dying well. Perſons ſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up do not leave the World, but are torn from it.</hi>

               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:34034:113"/>
               <p> Why boaſteſt thou thy ſelf, in Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, O mighty Man? The Goodneſs of God endureth continually. Thy Tongue deviſeth Miſchiefs; like a ſharp Razor, working deceitfully. Thou loveſt Evil more than Good; and Lying, rather than to ſpeak Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Thou loveſt all devouring, O thou deceitful Tongue. God ſhall likewiſe deſtroy thee for ever, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52. 1. <hi>There is Meanneſs in Boaſting, in Malice, in Detraction and Lying, which is not conſiſtent with true Honor. Where there is Quality, there ought to be an Abhorrence of all that is thus Baſe; and nothing can be more degrading, than to be familiar with it. What are then Titles, State and Birth, where there is a Familiarity with Lying, Detraction, Malice and Vanity? Such may make a Shew at a Diſtance, but more nearly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd, they are certainly Contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible. Without Repentance, their Fate muſt be to be deſpis'd and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled on by Devils.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seeſt thou a Man diligent in his Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? He ſhall ſtand before Kings, he
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:34034:114"/> ſhall not ſtand before mean Men, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. 29. <hi>Sloth is unbecoming all States; and where is the Honor of being a Drone? Induſtry with a low Birth, is more Honorable than uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Quality. Is he Idle and Lazy? Say no more; whatever his Blood be, he is Infamous.</hi>

                  <hi>Daniel</hi> purpoſed in his Heart, that he would not defile himſelf with the Portion of the King's Meat, nor with the Wine which he drank: Therefore he requeſted of the Prince of the Eunuchs, that he might not defile himſelf, <hi>Dan.</hi> 1. 8. <hi>True Greatneſs of Mind; not to tranſgreſs the Law of God, in Compliance with the King!

               <p>Hear this word, ye Kine of <hi>Baſhan,</hi> that are in the Mountain of <hi>Samaria,</hi> which oppreſs the Poor, which cruſh the Needy, which ſay to their Maſters, bring and let us drink, <hi>Amos</hi> 4. 1. <hi>This was the Crime of the great Ones of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Oppreſſion and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wo to them, that are at eaſe in <hi>Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and truſt in the Mountain of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria,—</hi>ye that put far away the evil Day, and cauſe the Seat of Violence to come near, that lye upon Beds of Ivory, and ſtretch themſelves upon their Couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and eat the Lambs out of the Flock, and the Calves out of the midſt of the Stall; that chant to the Sound of the Viol, and invent to themſelves Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Muſic, like <hi>David,</hi> that drink Wine in Bowls, and anoint themſelves with the chief Ointments, but they are not grieved for the Affliction of <hi>Joſeph:</hi> Therefore now ſhall they go Captive, with the firſt, that go Captive, and the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet of them, that ſtretched themſelves,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:34034:115"/> ſhall be removed: The Lord God hath ſworn by himſelf, ſaith the Lord the God of Hoſts, I abhorr the Excellency of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and hate his Palaces: Therefore will I deliver up the City, with all that is therein, Amos 6. 1, 3. <hi>The Prophet reckons up the Provocations of</hi> Iſrael; <hi>their Life of Eaſe, of Oppreſſion, of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive Ambition, Gluttony, Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs, Divertiſements, Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, effeminate Nicety and Softneſs. And was it thus, O</hi> Iſrael, <hi>thou didſt draw upon thy ſelf the hatred of God and Deſolation? Then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy all they, who walk on in theſe Steps.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quality is Honorable, and has many Advantages both as to this World and the next, in the Plenty of Bleſſings annext to it. But then, muſt not this be receiv'd, as a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Maxim, that nothing is truly Honorable, which God deſpiſes? And what is the Conſequence of this, but, that if Perſons of Quality, by their Irregularities and Sins, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake God, they forfeit their Dignity,</hi>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:34034:115"/> 
                  <hi>and tho' ſtill ſaluted with Honor by Men, are not really Honorable? For tho' Man may be ſo unjuſt, as to deſpiſe what is truly Valuable; yet, not ſo in God; what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſes, is moſt certainly deſpicable. By this Rule, may Perſons of this Degree, ſee the only Expedient of maintaining the Dignity of their Rank, that is, by the Practice of ſolid Virtue, and being Faithful in the ſervice of that ſoveraign and infinite Majeſty, which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs and adore: If they forſake this Way, there is ſo much of Falſeneſs, Baſeneſs and Treachery Inſeparable from a Life of Folly and Vice, that there can be no claim to Honor, where there is nothing but what deſerves Contempt.</hi>

When his Diſciples heard it, they were exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly amazed, ſaying, who then can be ſaved? But Jeſus beheld them, and ſaid unto them, with Men this is impoſſible,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:34034:116"/> but with God all things are poſſible, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 23.</p>
                  <p>Wo unto you, that are rich; for ye have received your conſolation. Wo unto you, that are full: For ye ſhall hunger. Wo unto you, that laugh now, for ye ſhall mourn and weep, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 24.</p>
                  <p>And he ſaid unto them, take heed and beware of Covetouſneſs; for a Man's Life conſiſteth not in the Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the things, which he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth. And he ſpake a Parable unto them, ſaying, the Ground of a certain rich Man brought forth plentifully. And he thought within himſelf, ſaying, what ſhall I do, becauſe I have no room, where to beſtow my Fruits? And he ſaid, this will I do, I will pull down my Barns, and build greater; and there will I beſtow all my Fruits and my Goods. And I will ſay to my Soul, Soul, thou haſt much Goods laid up for many Years; take thine Eaſe, eat, drink and be merry. But God ſaid unto him, thou Fool, this night thy Soul ſhall be required of thee. Then, whoſe ſhall thoſe things be, which thou haſt provided? So is he, that
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:34034:117"/> layeth up Treaſure for himſelf, and is not rich towards God, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 15.</p>
                  <p>There was a certain rich Man, which was cloathed in Purple, and fine Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, and fared ſumptuouſly every Day. And there was a certain Beggar, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Lazarus,</hi> which was laid at his Gate full of Sores. And deſiring to be fed with the Crumbs, which fell from the rich Man's Table: Moreover the Dogs came and licked his Sores. And it came to paſs, that the Beggar died, and was carried by the Angels into <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Boſom: The rich Man alſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and was buried. And in Hell he lift up his Eyes, being in Torments, and ſeeth <hi>Abraham</hi> afar off, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> in his Boſom. And he cried and ſaid, Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> have mercy on me, and ſend <hi>Lazarus</hi> that he may dip the Tip of his Finger in Water and cool my Tongue; for I am tormented in this Flame. But <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid, Son, remember, that thou in thy Life-time receivedſt thy good things, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Lazarus</hi> evil things: But now he is comforted, and thou art tormented, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 19.</p>

                  <p> Go to now ye rich Men, weep and howl for your Miſeries, that ſhall come upon you. Your Riches are corrupted, and your Garments are moth-eaten. Your Gold and Silver is cankered; and the Ruſt of them ſhall be a witneſs againſt you, and ſhall eat your Fleſh, as it were Fire: Ye have heaped Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure together for the laſt Days. Behold, the Hire of the Labourers, which have reaped down your Fields, which is of you kept back by Fraud, crieth, and the Cries of them, which have reaped, are entred into the Ears of the Lord of Sabbath.

                  <p>They, that will be rich, fall into Temptation and a Snare, and into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hurtful Luſts, which drown Men in Deſtruction and Perdition.

                  <p>Is not thy Wickedneſs great, and thine Iniquities infinite? For thou haſt taken a Pledge from thy Brother for nought, and ſtripped the Naked of their Cloathing. Thou haſt not given Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Weary to drink, and thou haſt withholden Bread from the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry.—Thou haſt ſent Widows away empty, and the Arms of the Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs have been broken.

                  <p> Some remove the Land-marks: They violently take away Flocks, and feed thereof.

                  <p>When the Ear heard me, then it bleſſed me; and when the Eye ſaw me, it gave witneſs to me: Becauſe I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Poor, that cried, and the Fatherleſs, and him, that had none to help him. The Bleſſing of him, that was ready to periſh, came upon me, and
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:34034:125"/> I cauſed the Widow's Heart to ſing for Joy.—I was Eyes to the Blind, and Feet was I to the Lame. I was a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Poor, and the Cauſe, which I knew not, I ſearched out, <hi>Job</hi> 29. 11.</p>
                  <p>If I have withheld the Poor from their deſire, or have cauſed the Eyes of the Widow to fail; or have eaten my Morſel my ſelf alone, and the Fatherleſs hath not eaten thereof:—If I have ſeen any periſh for want of Cloathing, or any Poor without Covering: If his Loins have not bleſſed me, and if he were not warmed with the Fleece of my Sheep: If I have lift up my Hand againſt the Fatherleſs, when I ſaw my help in the Gate: Then let mine Arm fall from my Shoulder-blade, and mine Arm be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the Bone, <hi>Job</hi> 31. 16.</p>
                  <p>Bleſſed is he, that conſidereth the Poor; the Lord will deliver him in the time of Trouble. The Lord will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him and keep him alive, and he ſhall be bleſſed upon the Earth; and thou wilt not deliver him unto the Will of his Enemies: The Lord will ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then him upon the Bed of Languiſhing; thou wilt make all his Bed in his Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41. 1.</p>

                  <p> Is not this the Faſt, that I have choſen? To looſe the Bonds of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to undo the heavy Burthens, and to let the Oppreſſed go free, and that ye break every Yoke? Is it not to deal thy Bread to the Hungry, and that thou bring the Poor, that are caſt out, to thy Houſe? When thou ſeeſt the Naked, that thou cover him, and that thou hide not thy ſelf from thine own Fleſh? Then ſhall thy Light break forth, as the Morning, and thine Health ſhall ſpring forth ſpeedily; and thy Righteouſneſs ſhall go before thee, the Glory of the Lord ſhall be thy Reward. Then ſhalt thou call, and the Lord ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; thou ſhalt cry, and he ſhall ſay, here I am: If thou take away from the midſt of thee the Yoke, the putting forth of the Finger, and ſpeaking Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: And if thou draw out thy Soul to the Hungry, and ſatisfie the afflicted Soul; then ſhall thy Light riſe in Obſcurity, and thy Darkneſs be as the Noon-day. And the Lord ſhall guide thee continually, and ſatisfie thy Soul in drought, and make fat thy Bones: And thou ſhalt be like a watered Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,

               <p>Bleſſed are the Poor in Spirit; for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 3.</p>
               <pb n="263" facs="tcp:34034:127"/>
               <p> Take no Thought, ſaying, what ſhall we eat? Or what ſhall we drink? Or wherewithal ſhall we be cloathed? (For after all theſe things do the Gentiles ſeek) for your heavenly Father knoweth, that ye have need of all theſe things. But ſeek ye firſt the Kingdom of God, and his Righteouſneſs, and all theſe things ſhall be added unto you, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 31.</p>
               <p>Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto them, go and ſhew <hi>John</hi> again thoſe things, which ye do hear and ſee: The Blind receive their Sight, and the Lame Walk, the Lepers are Cleanſed, and the Deaf Hear, the Dead are raiſed up, and the Poor have the Goſpel preached to them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 4.</p>
               <p>A certain Scribe came, and ſaid unto him, Maſter, I will follow thee, whitherſoever thou goeſt. And Jeſus ſaith unto him, the Foxes have Holes, and the Birds of the Air have Neſts: But the Son of Man hath not where to lay his Head, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peter</hi> began to ſay unto him, lo, we have left all, and have followed thee. And Jeſus anſwered and ſaid, verily,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:34034:128"/> I ſay unto you, there is no Man, that hath left Houſe, or Brethren, or Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, or Father, or Mother, or Wife, or Children, or Lands for my ſake and the Goſpel's, but he ſhall receive an hundred-fold now in this time,—and in the World to come, eternal Life. But many, that are firſt, ſhall be laſt: And and the laſt, firſt, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10. 28.</p>
               <p>And there came a certain poor Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and ſhe threw in two Mites, which make a Farthing. And he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto him his Diſciples, and ſaith unto them, Verily, I ſay unto you, that this poor Widow hath caſt more in, than all they, which have caſt into the Treaſury. For all they did caſt in of their abundance; but ſhe of her want, did caſt in all, that ſhe had, even all her Living, <hi>Mar.</hi> 12. 42.</p>
               <p>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe he hath anointed me to preach the Goſpel to the Poor, he hath ſent me to heal the Broken-hearted, to preach Deliverance to the Captives, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering of Sight to the Blind, to ſet at Liberty them, that are bruiſed, to preach
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:34034:128"/> the acceptable Year of the Lord.—And he began to ſay unto them, this Day is this Scripture fulfilled in your Ears, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 18, 21.</p>
               <p>He lifted up his Eyes on his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and ſaid, Bleſſed be ye Poor, for yours is the Kingdom of God. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are ye, that hunger now; for ye ſhall be filled. Bleſſed are ye, that weep now; for ye ſhall laugh, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 20.</p>
               <p>Then the Maſter of the Houſe being Angry, ſaid to his Servant, Go out quickly into the Streets and Lanes of the City, and bring in hither the Poor, and the Maimed, and the Halt, and the Blind. And the Servant ſaid, Lord, it is done, as thou haſt command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and yet there is room. And the Lord ſaid unto the Servant, Go out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the High-ways and Hedges, and compel them to come in, that my Houſe may be filled. For I ſay unto you, that none of thoſe Men, which were bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, ſhall taſte of my Supper, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. 21.</p>
               <p>There was a certain Beggar named <hi>Lazarus,</hi> which was laid at his Gate
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:34034:129"/> full of Sores; and deſiring to be fed with the Crumbs, which fell from the rich Man's Table; moreover the Dogs came and licked his Sores. And it came to paſs, that the Beggar died, and was carried by the Angels into <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>'s Boſom, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 20.</p>
               <p>Ye ſee your Calling, Brethren, how that not many wiſe Men after the Fleſh, not many Mighty, not many Noble are called. But God hath choſen the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh things of the World, to confound the wiſe; and God hath choſen the weak things of the World, to confound the things, which are mighty: and baſe things of the World, and things, which are deſpiſed, hath God choſen, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 26.</p>
               <p>Moreover Brethren, we do you to wit of the Grace of God beſtowed on the Churches of <hi>Macedonia:</hi> How that in a great Trial of Affliction, the Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of their Joy, and their deep Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty abounded unto the riches of their Liberality. For to their Power (I bear record) yea, and beyond their Power, they were willing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, praying us with much entreaty,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:34034:129"/> that we would receive the Gift.—Ye know the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that tho' he was Rich, yet for your ſakes he became Poor, that ye, thro' his Poverty, might be Rich, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 1, 9.</p>
               <p>Let this mind be in you, which was alſo in Jeſus Chriſt; who being in the form of God, thought it not Robbery, to be equal with God: But made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of no Reputation, and took upon him the form of a Servant, and was made in the likeneſs of Men: And being found in faſhion as a Man, he Humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and became Obedient unto Death, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Death of the Croſs. Wherefore God alſo hath highly exalted him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 5.</p>
               <p>Godlineſs with Contentment is great Gain: For we brought nothing into this World, and it is certain, we can carry nothing out. And having Food and Raiment, let us be therewith content. But they that will be Rich fall into Temptation, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 6.</p>
               <p>Let your Converſation be without Covetouſneſs; and be content with ſuch things, as ye have: For he hath ſaid, I will never leave thee, nor forſake
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:34034:130"/> thee. So that, we may boldly ſay, the Lord is my Helper, and I will not fear, what Man ſhall do unto me, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5.</p>
               <p>Humble your ſelves therefore under the mighty Hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time: caſting all your Care upon him, for he careth for you, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 6.</p>
               <p>Let the Brother of low Degree rejoice in that he is exalted:—Bleſſed is the Man, that endureth Temptation: For when he is tried, he ſhall receive the Crown of Life, which the Lord hath promiſed to them that love him, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 9, 12.</p>
               <p>Hearken, my beloved Brethren, hath not God choſen the Poor of this World, Rich in Faith, and Heirs of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which he hath promiſed to them, that love him? <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 5.</p>
               <p>Not that I ſpeak in reſpect of Want; for I have learned, in whatſoever State I am, therewith to be content. I know, both how to be abaſed; and I know how to abound: Every-where and in all things I am inſtructed, both to be full, and to be hungry; both to abound, and
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:34034:130"/> to ſuffer need. I can do all things thro' Chriſt, which ſtrengtheneth me. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my Affliction, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 11.</p>
               <p>Theſe things ſaith the Firſt and the Laſt, which was dead, and is alive; I know thy Works, and Tribulation, and Poverty, but thou art Rich.—Fear none of theſe things, which thou ſhalt ſuffer: Behold, the Devil ſhall caſt ſome of you into Priſon, that ye may be tried; and ye ſhall have Tribulation ten Days: Be thou Faithful unto Death, and I will give thee a Crown of Life, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Some additions out of the Old Teſtament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would ſeek unto God, and unto God would I commit my Cauſe.—He ſaveth the Poor from the Sword, from their Mouth, and from the Hand of the Mighty. So the Poor hath Hope, and Iniquity ſtoppeth her Mouth, <hi>Job</hi> 5. 15.</p>
               <p>The Lord alſo will be a Refuge for the Oppreſſed; a Refuge in times of Trouble. And they, that know thy
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:34034:131"/> Name, will put their truſt in thee: For thou, Lord, haſt not forſaken them, that ſeek thee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9. 9, 10. The Needy ſhall not alway be forgotten; the Expectation of the Poor ſhall not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh for ever, <hi>v.</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>Why ſtandeſt thou afar off, O Lord? Why hideſt thou thy ſelf in times of Trouble? The Wicked in his Pride doth perſecute the Poor: Let them be taken in the Devices, that they have imagined.—Ariſe, O Lord, O God, lift up thine Hand; forget not the Humble. Wherefore doth the Wicked contemn God? He hath ſaid in his Heart; thou wilt not require it. Thou haſt ſeen it; for thou beholdeſt Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief and Spite, to requite it with thy Hand: The Poor committeth himſelf unto thee, thou art the Helper of the Fatherleſs.—Lord, thou haſt heard the Deſire of the Humble: Thou wilt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare their Heart, thou wilt cauſe thine Ear to hear: To judge the Fatherleſs and the Oppreſſed, that the Man of the Earth may no more oppreſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. 1, 12, 17.</p>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:34034:131"/>
               <p> I ſought the Lord, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my Fears.—This Poor Man cried and the Lord heard him, and ſaved him out of all his Troubles. The Angel of our Lord encampeth round about them, that fear him, and delivereth them. O taſte and ſee, that the Lord is good; bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is the Man, that truſteth in him. O fear the Lord, ye his Saints: For there is no want to them, that fear him.—The Righteous cry, and the Lord heareth and delivereth them out of all their Troubles. The Lord is nigh unto them, that are of a broken Heart; and ſaveth ſuch, as be of a contrite Spirit. Many are the Afflictions of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; but the Lord delivereth him out of them all. He keepeth all his Bones; not one of them is broken.—The Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemeth the Soul of his Servants; and none of them, that truſt in him, ſhall be deſolate, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. 4, 6, 17.</p>
               <p>Truſt in the Lord, and do good, ſo ſhalt thou dwell in the Land, and veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thou ſhalt be fed. Delight thy ſelf alſo in the Lord, and he ſhall give thee the Deſires of thine Heart. Commit
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:34034:132"/> thy Way unto the Lord, and he ſhall bring it to paſs.—Reſt in the Lord, and wait patiently: Fret not thy ſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of him, who proſpereth in his Way;—for evil Doers ſhall be cut off, but thoſe, that wait upon the Lord, they ſhall inherit the Earth.—A little, that a righteous Man hath, is better than the Riches of many Wicked.—The Lord knoweth the Days of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright; and their Inheritance ſhall be for ever: They ſhall not be aſhamed in the evil Time; and in the Days of Famine they ſhall be ſatisfied.—The Steps of a good Man are ordered by the Lord; and he delighteth in his Way. Tho' he fall, he ſhall not be utterly caſt down, for the Lord up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth him with his Hand. I have been young, and now am old: Yet have I not ſeen the Righteous forſaken, nor his Seed begging Bread, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 3, 7, 16, 18, 23.</p>
               <p>Why art thou caſt down, O my Soul? And why art thou diſquieted within me? Hope in God, for I ſhall yet praiſe him, who is the Health of my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and my God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 43. 5.</p>
               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:34034:132"/>
               <p> Thou makeſt us a Reproach to our Neighbors, a Scorn and a Deriſion to them, that are round about us. Thou makeſt us a By-word among the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, a ſhaking of the Head among the People.—All this is come upon us, yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falſly in thy Covenant. Our Heart is not turned back, neither have our Steps declined from thy Ways, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44. 13, 17.</p>
               <p>I am Poor and Sorrowful; let thy Salvation, O God, ſet me upon High.—For the Lord heareth the Poor, and deſpiſeth not his Priſoners, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. 29, 33.</p>
               <p>He ſhall judge thy People with Righteouſneſs, and thy Poor with Judgment.—He ſhall judge the Poor of the People, he ſhall ſave the Children of the Needy, and ſhall break in pieces the Oppreſſor.—He ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the Needy, when he crieth; the Poor alſo, and him, that hath no Helper. He ſhall ſpare the Poor and Needy; and ſhall ſave the Souls of the Needy. He ſhall redeem their Soul from Deceit and Violence; and precious ſhall their
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:34034:133"/> Blood be in his Sight. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72. 2, 12.</p>
               <p>Who is like unto the Lord our God, who dwelleth on High?—He raiſeth up the Poor out of the Duſt, and lifteth the Needy out of the Dunghil: That he may ſet him with Princes, even with the Princes of his People, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 113. 5, 7.</p>
               <p>I know, that the Lord will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Cauſe of the Afflicted, and the Right of the Poor, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 140. 12.</p>
               <p>Better is a Little with the Fear of the Lord, than great Treaſure and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble therewith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 16.</p>
               <p>Better is a Little with Righteouſneſs, than great Revenues without Right, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 8.</p>
               <p>Better is a dry Morſel, and Quietneſs therewith, than a Houſefull of Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with Strife, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17. 1.</p>
               <p>Better is the Poor, that walketh in his Integrity, than he, that is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe in his Lips, and is a Fool, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 1.</p>
               <p>Thou haſt been a Strength to the Poor, a Strength to the Needy in his Diſtreſs, a Refuge from the Storm, a Shadow from the Heat, when the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:34034:133"/> Blaſt of the terrible Ones is as a Storm againſt the Wall, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25. 4.</p>
               <p>Yea, in the Way of thy Judgments, O Lord, have we waited for thee; the deſire of our Soul is to thy Name, and to the Remembrance of thee. With my Soul have I deſir'd thee in the Night, yea, with my Spirit within me will I ſeek thee early: For when thy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are in the Earth, the Inhabitants of the World will learn Righteouſneſs.—Lord, in Trouble have they viſited thee, they poured out a Prayer, when thy chaſtening was upon them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 8.</p>
               <p>It is of the Lord's Mercies, that we are not conſumed, becauſe his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions fail not: They are New every Morning; great is thy Faithfulneſs. The Lord is my Portion, ſaith my Soul, therefore will I hope in him. The Lord is good unto them, that wait for him, to the Soul, that ſeeketh him. It is good, that a Man ſhould both hope, and quietly wait for the Salvation of the Lord. It is good for a Man, that he bear the Yoke in his Youth. He ſitteth alone, and keepeth ſilence, becauſe he hath born it upon him. He putteth his Mouth in
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:34034:134"/> the Duſt, if ſo be there may be Hope.—For the Lord will not caſt off for ever. But tho' he cauſe Grief, yet will he have Compaſſion; according to the Multitude of his Mercies. For he doth not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict willingly, nor grieve the Children of Men.—Wherefore doth a living Man complain, a Man for the Puniſhment of his Sins? Let us ſearch and try our Ways, and turn again to the Lord. Let us lift up our Heart with our Hands unto God in the Heavens, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 22.</p>

                  <hi>Thus do's the Spirit of God ſpeak in the Caſe of the Poor, and Diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; evidently diſcovering, that however by this World they are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd unhappy, yet that God has a particular Regard to them, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes their Protection, and makes ſo many Promiſes to them, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be queſtion'd, but, as to the next World, they have much the Advantage above thoſe, who enjoy themſelves in plenty.

If in this Spirit they live, I think, they have more ſolid Grounds for true Comfort, than the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all worldly Poſſeſſions can afford, and may have a great Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of God's Promiſes to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd in them, in the Bleſſings of a happy Eternity.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XXXV. Of thoſe, who have the Care of the Flock.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> WHAT Directions do's the Goſpel give to Perſons of this Character?</p>
               <pb n="278" facs="tcp:34034:135"/>
               <p> A. <hi>It ſpeaks very particularly to them, and is very full both in the Inſtructions and Charge it gives them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ye are the Salt of the Earth; but if the Salt have loſt his Savour, wherewith ſhall it be Salted? It is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be caſt out, and to be trodden under Foot of Men. Ye are the Light of the World: A City, that is ſet on a Hill, cannot be hid. Neither do Men light a Candle, and put it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Buſhel; but on a Candleſtick, and it giveth Light to all, that are in the Houſe. Let your Light ſo ſhine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Men, that they may ſee your good Works, and glorifie your Father, which is in Heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 13. <hi>They are to be Exemplar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If a Man have an hundred Sheep, and one of them be gone aſtray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the Mountains, and ſeeketh that, which is gone aſtray? <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 12. <hi>They are to be ſolicitous in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the loſt Sheep.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was alſo a Strife among them, which of them ſhould be accounted the
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:34034:135"/> greateſt. And he ſaid unto them. The Kings of the Gentiles exerciſe Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip over them; and they, that exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Authority upon them, are called. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors. But ye ſhall not be ſo: But he, that is greateſt among you, let him be, as the Younger; and he, that is Chief, as he, that doth ſerve. For whether is greater, he that ſitteth at Meat, or he that ſerveth? Is not he, that ſitteth at Meat? But I am among you, as he that ſerveth, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 24. <hi>They are to be Humble in Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verily, verily I ſay unto you, He that entreth not by the Door, into the Sheepfold, but climbeth up ſome other Way, the ſame is a Thief and a Robber. But he, that entreth in by the Door, is the Shepherd of the Sheep. To him the Porter openeth; and the Sheep hear his Voice: And he calleth his own Sheep by Name, and leadeth them out. And when he putteth forth his own Sheep, he goeth before them, and the Sheep follow him; for they know his Voice, <hi>Jo.</hi> 10. 1. <hi>They are to conſider their Vocation.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="280" facs="tcp:34034:136"/>
               <p> I am the good Shepherd: The good Shepherd giveth his Life for the Sheep. But he, that is an Hireling, and not the Shepherd, whoſe own the Sheep are not, ſeeth the Wolf coming, and leaveth the Sheep, and fleeth: And the Wolf catcheth them, and ſcattereth the Sheep. The Hireling fleeth, becauſe he is an Hireling, and careth not for the Sheep. I am the good Shepherd, and know my Sheep, and am known of mine, <hi>Jo.</hi> 10. 11. <hi>They are to employ and give their Life, for the good of their Flock.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ye have not choſen me, but I have choſen you, and ordain'd you, that ye ſhould go and bring forth Fruit, and that your Fruit ſhould remain, <hi>Jo.</hi> 15. 16. <hi>They are to remember the end of their being call'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Jeſus ſaith to <hi>Simon Peter, Simon</hi> Son of <hi>Jonas,</hi> loveſt thou me more than theſe? He ſaith unto him, yea, Lord, thou knoweſt that I love thee; he ſaith unto him, Feed my Lambs. He ſaith to him again the ſecond time, <hi>Simon,</hi> Son of <hi>Jonas,</hi> loveſt thou me? He ſaith unto him, Yea, Lord, thou knoweſt, that
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:34034:136"/> I love thee. He ſaith unto him, Feed my Sheep, <hi>Jo.</hi> 21. 15. <hi>The Love of Jeſus the neceſſary Preparation for taking charge of their Flock.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As they miniſtred to the Lord, and faſted, the Holy Ghoſt ſaid, Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate me <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> for the Work whereunto I have called them. And when they had faſted and prayed, and laid their Hands on them, they ſent them away, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 2. <hi>Good Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for undertaking the Care of the Flock.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take heed therefore unto your ſelves, and to all the Flock, over the which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you Overſeers, to feed the Church of God, which he hath purchaſed with his own Blood. For I know this, that after my departing, ſhall grievous Wolves enter in among you, not ſparing the Flock. Alſo of your own ſelves ſhall Men ariſe, ſpeaking perverſe things, to draw away Diſciples after them. Therefore watch, and remember, that by the ſpace of three Years, I ceaſed not to warn every one Night and Day with Tears, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. <hi>Vigilance and Fidelity neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for Paſtors.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="282" facs="tcp:34034:137"/>
               <p> This is a true Saying, if a Man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the Office of a Biſhop, he deſireth a good Work. A Biſhop then muſt be blameleſs, the Husband of one Wife, Vigilant, Sober, of good Behavior, given to Hoſpitality, apt to Teach; not given to Wine, no Striker, not greedy of filthy Lucre, but Patient, not a Brawler, not Covetous; one, that ruleth well his own Houſe, having his Children in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection with all Gravity; (for if a Man know not how to rule his own Houſe, how ſhall he take Care of the Church of God?) Not a Novice, leſt being lifted up with Pride, he fall into the Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Devil. Moreover he muſt have a good Report of them, which are without, leſt he fall into Reproach, and the Snare of the Devil, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>Neceſſary Qualifications of Paſtors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If thou put the Brethren in Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of theſe things, thou ſhalt be a good Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, nouriſhed up in the Words of Faith, and of good Doctrin, whereunto thou haſt attained. But refuſe profane and old Wives Fables, and exerciſe thy ſelf rather unto Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: For Bodily Exerciſe profiteth little;
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:34034:137"/> but Godlineſs is profitable unto all things, having Promiſe of the Life, that now is, and of that, which is to come.—Let no Man deſpiſe thy Youth; but be thou an Example of the Believers, in VVord, in Converſation, in Charity, in Spirit, in Faith, in Purity. Till I come, give attendance to Reading, to Exhortation, to Doctrin. Neglect not the Gift, that is in thee, which was given thee by Prophecy, with the laying on of the Hands of the Presbytery. Meditate upon theſe things, give thy ſelf wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all. Take heed unto thy ſelf, and unto thy Doctrin; continue in them: For in doing this, thou ſhalt both ſave thy ſelf, and them, that hear thee, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 6, 12. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Inſtructions;</hi> 1. <hi>To be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd by Faith.</hi> 2. <hi>To avoid Fables.</hi> 3. <hi>To follow Piety.</hi> 4. <hi>To give good Example.</hi> 5. <hi>To Read and Teach.</hi> 6. <hi>Not to neglect Grace.</hi> 7. <hi>To Meditate.</hi> 8. <hi>To be watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful over themſelves and their Flock. Laſtly, To perſevere in Duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="284" facs="tcp:34034:138"/>
               <p> Rebuke not an Elder, but intreat him as a Father, and the younger Men as Brethren; the elder Women as Mothers, the Younger as Siſters, with all Purity, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 1. I charge thee before God and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the elect Angels, that thou obſerve theſe things, without preferring one before another, doing nothing by Partiality. Lay Hands ſuddenly on no Man, neither be Parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of other Mens Sins: Keep thy ſelf pure, <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>How ſtrict a charge againſt all kind of Partiality!</hi> Them that Sin rebuke before all, that others alſo may fear, <hi>v.</hi> 20. <hi>Public Sin to be reprov'd in Public.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O <hi>Timothy,</hi> keep that, which is committed to thy Truſt, avoiding pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and vain Bablings, and Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Science falſly ſo called: VVhich ſome profeſſing, have erred concerning the Faith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 20. <hi>They are faithfully to keep what is deliver'd, avoid unprofitable Diſputes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hold faſt the form of ſound VVords, which thou haſt heard of me, in Faith and Love, which is in Chriſt Jeſus. That good thing, which was committed
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:34034:138"/> unto thee, keep by the Holy Ghoſt, which dwelleth in us, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13.</p>
               <p>Thou therefore, my Son, be ſtrong in the Grace, that is in Chriſt Jeſus. And the things, that thou haſt heard of me among many Witneſſes, the ſame commit thou to faithful Men, who ſhall be able to teach others alſo. Thou therefore endure Hardneſs, as a good Soldier of Jeſus Chriſt. No Man, that warreth, entangleth himſelf with the affairs of this Life; that he may pleaſe him, who hath choſen him to be a Soldier, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>They are to be ſtrong in Grace: Faithful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverers of the Truths receiv'd: Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous in all the Difficulties of their Miniſtry: Not engag'd in worldly Affairs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of theſe things put them in Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, charging them before the Lord, that they ſtrive not about Words, to no profit, but to the ſubverting of the Hearers. Study to ſhew thy ſelf ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved unto God; a Workman that needeth not to be aſhamed, rightly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding the Word of Truth. But ſhun prophane and vain Bablings; for they
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:34034:139"/> will encreaſe unto more <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs.—Flee alſo youthful Luſts; but follow Righteouſneſs, Faith, Charity, Peace, with them, that call on the Lord out of a pure Heart. But fooliſh and unlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Queſtions avoid, knowing that they do gender Strifes. And the Servant of the Lord muſt not ſtrive; but be Gentle unto all Men, apt to Teach, Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; in Meekneſs inſtructing thoſe that oppoſe themſelves; if God Peradventure will give them Repentance, to the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of the Truth, and that they may recover themſelves out of the Snare of the Devil, who are taken Captive by him, at his Will, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 14, 22. <hi>They are to baniſh Diſputes of Words.</hi> 2. <hi>Be Irreproachable in their Lives.</hi> 3. <hi>Diſpence worthily the Word of God.</hi> 4. <hi>Suppreſs corrupt Diſcourſe.</hi> 5. <hi>Subdue their own Paſſions, and follow the Spirit of the new Man.</hi> 6. <hi>Decline impertinent Contentions.</hi> 7. <hi>Be Meek to all, and ready to give their Help.</hi> 8. <hi>Be moderate in Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and Arguing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Continue thou in the things, which thou haſt learned, and haſt been aſſured
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:34034:139"/> of, knowing of whom thou haſt learned them; and that from a Child thou haſt known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee Wiſe unto Salvation, thro' Faith, which is in Chriſt Jeſus. All Scripture is given by Inſpiration of God, and is profitable for Doctrin, for Reproof, for Correction, for Inſtruction in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; that the Man of God may be perfect, throughly furniſhed unto all good Works, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 14. <hi>They are to be ſtedfaſt in Faith, knowing in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, make uſe of theſe for the Conduct of themſelves, for inſtructing, correcting and leading others in Ways of Piety and Juſtice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall judge the Quick and the Dead at his appearing, and his Kingdom: Preach the Word, be inſtant in Seaſon, out of Seaſon, reprove, rebuke, exhort with all Long-ſuffering, and Doctrin. For the time will come, when they will not endure ſound Doctrin; but after their own Luſts ſhall they heap to themſelves Teachers, having itching Ears. And they ſhall turn away their Ears from
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:34034:140"/> the Truth, and ſhall be turned unto Fables. But watch thou in all things, endure Afflictions, do the Work of an Evangeliſt, make full proof of thy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>They are to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy their Preaching, Reproof, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Threats and Patience, for the Salvation of their Flock. They are to be Watchful, bear patiently the Troubles of their Miniſtry, and by diſcharging all Duties fully ſatisfie it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For this Cauſe left I thee in <hi>Crete,</hi> that thou ſhouldeſt ſet in Order the things, that are wanting, and ordain Elders in every City, as I had appointed thee. If any be Blameleſs, the Husband of one Wife, having faithful Children, not accuſed of Riot, or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nruly. For a Biſhop muſt be Blameleſs, as the Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of God; not Self-willed, not ſoon Angry, not given to Wine, no Striker, not given to filthy Lucre; but a Lover of Hoſpitality, a Lover of good Men, Sober, Juſt, Holy, Temperate; holding faſt the faithful Word, as he hath been taught, that he may be able by ſound Doctrin, both to exhort and to
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:34034:140"/> convince the Gainſayers, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Qualifications of ſuch as undertake this Charge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe things ſpeak, and exhort, and rebuke with all Authority. Let no Man deſpiſe thee, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 15. <hi>They are to exhort and reprove, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Authority: Their Conduct ought to be ſuch, as to be deſpis'd by none.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Avoid fooliſh Queſtions, and Genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, and Contentions, and Strivings about the Law; for they are unprofitable and vain. A Man, that is an Heretick, after the firſt and ſecond Admonition, reject: Knowing, that he, that is ſuch, is ſubverted, and ſinneth, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of himſelf, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>They are to decline unprofitable Diſputes, and declar'd Hereticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Elders, which are among you, I exhort, who am alſo an Elder, and a Witneſs of the Sufferings of Chriſt, and alſo a Partaker of the Glory, that ſhall be revealed. Feed the Flock of God, which is among you, taking the Overſight thereof, not by conſtraint, but willingly; not for filthy Lucre,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:34034:141"/> but of a ready Mind; neither as being Lords over God's Heritage, but being Enſamples to the Flock. And when the chief Shepherd ſhall appear, ye ſhall reeeive a Crown of Glory, that fadeth not away, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>The true Shepherds, not for their own Intereſt, but for the Good of the Flock, watch over it; they lead it without lording it, and are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves an Example to it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Be watchful, and ſtrengthen the things, which remain, that are ready to die: For I have not found thy Works perfect before God. Remember there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how thou haſt received and heard, and hold faſt, and repent. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou ſhalt not watch, I will come on thee, as a Thief, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus ſpeaks the chief Shepherd to all thoſe, who, under him, have taken upon them the Care of his Flock; and from whom ſhould they learn the Obligations of their Charge, but from him? Happy they, who give ear to him.</hi>

                  <head>§. II. As to Teaching the Flock.</head>
                  <p>Jeſus came, and ſpake unto them, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, All power is given unto me in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and in earth. Go ye therefore and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt: Teaching them to obſerve all things, whatſoever I have commanded you: And lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world, Mat. 28. 19. <hi>The Commiſſion for teaching and preaching Chriſt muſt be from Chriſt, and no other Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of teaching Truth, but from him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As ye go, preach, ſaying, The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven is at Hand. Heal the Sick, cleanſe the Lepers, raiſe the Dead, caſt out Devils: freely ye have received, freely give, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 7. <hi>They are to be diſ-intereſſed: Do all good, and not look for a Reward from Man, but from God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He, that heareth you, heareth me: And he, that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me: And he, that deſpiſeth me, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:34034:142"/> him, that ſent me, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 16. <hi>Chriſt ſpeaks to his Flock, by thoſe, whom he has ſet over it, and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to teach. Chriſt is injur'd in the contempt of them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the day-time, he was teaching in the Temple, and at night he went out, and abode in the Mount, that is called the Mount of Olives, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21. 37. <hi>They, who teach others, are to have their time of frequent Retreat from the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; even the Spirit of Truth, whom the world cannot receive, <hi>Jo.</hi> 14. 16. When the Spirit of Truth is come, he will guide you into all Truth, Jo. 16. 13. <hi>No Security of Truth from Learning, but from the Spirit of God. What Gratitude due from the Flock to God, whilſt thoſe, who were to Teach it, were to be led by this Spirit!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then the Twelve called the multitude of the Diſciples unto them, and ſaid, It is not reaſon, that we ſhould leave the Word of God, and ſerve Tables, <hi>Act.</hi>
                     <pb n="293" facs="tcp:34034:142"/> 6. 2. <hi>To be engag'd in temporal Affairs is a hindrance to thoſe, who are to Teach.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When therefore <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> had no ſmall Diſſenſion and Diſputation with them, they determined, that <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and certain other of them, ſhould go up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> unto the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles and Elders about this queſtion, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 2. And the Apoſtles and Elders came together, for to conſider of this matter, <hi>V.</hi> 6. <hi>When Queſtions ariſe, they are not determin'd by</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Barnabas; <hi>but are referr'd to the Apoſtles and Elders of the Church, who aſſemble and conſider of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then pleaſed it the Apoſtles and Elders, with the whole Church, to ſend choſen Men of their own company to <hi>Antioch,</hi> with <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas;—</hi>and wrote Letters by them, after this manner; The Apoſtles, and Elders, and Brethren, ſend greeting unto the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, which are of the Gentiles in <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Cilicia.</hi> Foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as we have heard, that certain, which went out from us, have troubled you with Words, ſubverting your Souls,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:34034:143"/> ſaying, Ye muſt be Circumciſed, and keep the Law, to whom we gave no ſuch Commandment: It ſeemed good unto us, being aſſembled with one accord, to ſend choſen Men unto you.—For it ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden, than theſe neceſſary things, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 22. <hi>The Apoſtles and Elders aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled having determin'd the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion propos'd to them, ſend their Reſolution to the Faithful, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it upon the Authority of the Holy Ghoſt and of themſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When they were diſmiſſed, they came to <hi>Antioch:</hi> And when they had gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the multitude together, they delivered the Epiſtle; which when they had read, they rejoiced for the conſolation, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 30. <hi>The Reſolutions of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles aſſembled are receiv'd by the Faithful, and this with joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as they went through the Cities, they delivered them the Decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the Apoſtles and Elders, which were at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And ſo were the Churches eſtabliſhed in
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:34034:143"/> the Faith, and encreaſed in number daily, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 4. <hi>The Decrees of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Elders of the Church were deliver'd to the Faithful; ſo were the Churches eſtabliſh'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Take heed therefore unto your ſelves and to all the Flock, over the which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you Overſeers, to feed the Church of God, which he hath purchaſed with his own Blood. For I know this, that after my departing, ſhall grievous Wolves enter in among you, not ſparing the Flock. Alſo of your own ſelves ſhall men ariſe, ſpeaking perverſe things, to draw away Diſciples after them. Therefore watch, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. <hi>The Paſtors of the Church, by the Ordinance of the H.

                  </p>
                  <p>Ye know, from the firſt day, that I came into <hi>Aſia,</hi> after what manner I have been with you, at all Seaſons; ſerving the Lord with all Humility of Mind, and with many Tears, and Temptations, which befel me, by the lying in wait of
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:34034:144"/> the <hi>Jews.</hi> And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have ſhewed you, and have taught you pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, and from houſe to houſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 18. <hi>They that teach the Flock, are to perſevere in their Duty with Patience and Humility, amidſt the Difficulties of their Charge. They are not to diſſemble the Truth; but give Inſtructions in Families, as well as in Public.</hi> Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the Blood of all Men: For I have not ſhunned to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare unto you all the Counſel of God, <hi>v.</hi> 26. <hi>The guilt of their Blood, is upon Paſtors, who periſh, becauſe they have not been put in mind of their Duty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now, Brethren, I commend you to God, and to the Word of his Grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance, among all them, which are ſanctified. I have coveted no Man's Silver, or Gold, or Apparel. Yea, you your ſelves know, that theſe hands have miniſtred unto my neceſſities, and to them, that were with me, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 32. <hi>They, who Teach, ought to</hi>
                     <pb n="297" facs="tcp:34034:144"/> 
                     <hi>Pray for the Flock, and be as little a Burthen to them as they poſſible can.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am Debtor both to the <hi>Greeks</hi> and to the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> both to the wiſe, and to the unwiſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 14. <hi>They who Teach, do well in offering their Labor to all, Partiality ought not to be mixt with their Charity.</hi> I am not aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt: for it is the power of God unto Salvation to every one, that believeth, <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>They ought not to be aſham'd of the Truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt ſent me, not to Baptize, but to Preach the Goſpel: not with wiſdom of words, leſt the Croſs of Chriſt ſhould be made of none effect, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>Simplicity more becoming the Goſpel, than humane Eloquence.</hi> And I, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of Speech, or of Wiſdom, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring unto you the Teſtimony of God. For I determined not to know any thing among you, ſave Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucified.—And my Speech and my Preaching was not with enticing Words of Man's Wiſdom, but in Demonſtration
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:34034:145"/> of the Spirit, and of Power, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 1.</p>
                  <p>We are Laborers together with God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 9. Let a Man ſo account of us, as of the Miniſters of Chriſt, and Stewards of the Myſteries of God. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over it is required in Stewards, that a Man be found faithful, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>The Dignity of Preachers is very great: their Fidelity ought to be ſo too.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But with me it is a very ſmall thing, that I ſhould be judged of you, of Man's judgment, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3. <hi>They are not to be Solicitous, what Men ſay of them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Who goeth to warfare any time, at his own charges? Who planteth a Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a Flock, and eateth not of the Milk of the Flock? Say I theſe things as a Man? or ſaith not the Law the ſame alſo? For it is written in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Thou ſhalt not muzzle the mouth of the Ox, that treadeth out the Corn. Doth God take care for Oxen? or ſaith he it altogether for our ſakes? For our ſakes, no doubt, this is written:
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:34034:145"/> That he that ploweth ſhould plow in Hope; and that he, that threſheth in Hope, ſhould be Partaker of his Hope. If we have ſown unto you ſpiritual things, is it a great thing, if we ſhall reap your carnal things? If others be Partakers of this Power over you, are not we rather? Nevertheleſs we have not uſed this Power; but ſuffer all things, leſt we ſhould hinder the Goſpel of Chriſt. Do ye not know, that they, which miniſter about holy things, live of the things of the Temple? And they, which wait at the Altar, are Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers with the Altar? Even ſo hath the Lord ordained, that they, which preach the Goſpel, ſhould live of the Goſpel. But I have uſed none of theſe things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 7. <hi>It is allow'd Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to live by their Function, but not to make a Trade of it. S.</hi> Paul <hi>how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever made no uſe of this Allowance, and this is more Perfect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though I be free from all Men, yet have I made my ſelf Servant unto all, that I might gain the more.—To the Weak become I as Weak, that I might gain the Weak: I am made all things
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:34034:146"/> to all Men, that I might by all means ſave ſome, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 19, 22. <hi>A Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcendence of Charity proper for thoſe that teach.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, Brethren, if I come unto you ſpeaking with Tongues, what ſhall I profit you? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 6. <hi>Preaching or Teaching in an unknown Tongue can do no good to the Hearers. The Word of God ought to be deliver'd in ſuch a manner, as to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the Hearers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thanks be unto God, which always cauſeth us to triumph in Chriſt, and maketh manifeſt the Savour of his Knowledge by us in every Place. For we are unto God, a ſweet Savour of Chriſt, in them, that are ſaved, and in them that periſh. To the one we are the Savour of Death unto Death; and to the other, the Savour of Life unto Life.—For we are not as many, which corrupt the Word of God: But as of Sincerity, but as of God, in the Sight of God ſpeak we in Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14, 17. <hi>The Goſpel ought to be preach'd by Word and by good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. To Falſifie or Change the</hi>

                     <hi>Word of God is Sacrilegious. Where there is not true Sincerity, there is not the Spirit of the Goſpel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seeing we have this Miniſtry, as we have received Mercy, we faint not: But have renounced the hidden things of Diſhoneſty, not walking in Craftineſs, nor handling the Word of God Deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, but by Manifeſtation of the Truth, commending our ſelves to every Man's Conſcience in the Sight of God. But if our Goſpel be hid, it is hid to them, that are loſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>To ſuch A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes are the moſt holy Things ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; but how many Wo's to them, that incurr this Guilt!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We preach not our ſelves, but Chriſt Jeſus the Lord; and our ſelves your Servants for Jeſus ſake, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 5. <hi>What Prophanation! What Proſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Goſpel, in thoſe, who undertake to preach Jeſus Chriſt, and under this Cover ſeek themſelves!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have this Treaſure in Earthen Veſſels, that the Excellency of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er may be of God, and not of us. We are troubled on every ſide, yet not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed; we are perplexed, but not

In all Troubles, their Confidence is to be in him, whom they preach. They ought every Way to be ſo Religious, that the Life of Chriſt may be manifeſted in all they ſuffer, and in all they do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God hath given to us the Miniſtry of Reconciliation;—and hath committed unto us the Word of Reconciliation. Now then we are Embaſſadors for Chriſt, as tho' God did beſeech you by us: We pray you in Chriſt's ſtead, be ye reconciled to God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 18. We then, as Workers together with him, beſeech you alſo, that ye receive not the Grace of God in vain.—Giving no Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in any thing, that the Miniſtry be not blamed: But in all things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving our ſelves, as the Miniſters of God, in much Patience, in Afflictions, in Neceſſities, in Diſtreſſes, in Stripes,

And what ought to be their Sanctity, who are no others than Vicars of Chriſt!

                  <p>Do I ſeek to pleaſe Men? For if I yet pleaſed Men, I ſhould not be the Servant of Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>Hence is the Corruption of the Goſpel; they, who ſhould ſeek nothing but Jeſus, endeavour to pleaſe the World, and to gain Eſteem.

                  <p>When it pleaſed God, who ſeparated me from my Mother's Womb, and called me by his Grace: To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Heathen; immediately I conferred not with Fleſh and Blood, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>Fleſh and Blood are not to be Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors in the Cauſe of the Goſpel and the Delivery of its Truths.</hi>

                  <hi>that appertained unto</hi> Korah, <hi>and all their goods.—And there came out a fire from the Lord, and conſumed the two hundred and fifty Men, that offered In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe,</hi> Num. 16. 1, 26, 32, 35. The Congregation being holy, Exempts them not from their Obedience en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd. The Authority of Princes of the Congregation, Men Famous and of Renown, is not enough for queſtioning the Authority of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> whom God had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all to hear and obey. Their offering Incenſe to God is not accepted, while divided from <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> they are under the guilt of Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>

                  <hi>Thou ſhalt come unto the Prieſts, the Levites, and unto the Judge, that ſhall be in thoſe days, and enquire; and they ſhall ſhew thee the Sentence of Judgment. And thou ſhalt do according to the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, which they of that place (which the Lord ſhall chuſe) ſhall ſhew thee; and thou ſhalt obſerve to do, according to all, that they inform thee: according to the Sentence of the Law, which they ſhall teach thee; and</hi>

                  <hi>according to the Judgment, which they ſhall tell thee, thou ſhalt do; thou ſhalt not decline from the Sentence, which they ſhall ſhew thee, to the Right Hand, nor to the Left. And the Man, that will do preſumptuouſly, and will not hearken unto the Prieſt (that ſtandeth to Miniſter there before the Lord thy God) or unto the Judge, even that Man ſhall die: And thou ſhalt put away the evil from</hi> Iſrael. <hi>And all the people ſhall hear, and fear, and do no more preſumptuouſly,</hi> Deut. 17. 9. How ſtrict is the Diſcipline enjoin'd by God in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Caſes! How ſevere the Puniſhment of Diſobedience!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> Samuel <hi>ſaith, Hath the Lord as great delight in Burnt Offerings and Sacrifices, as in obeying the Voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey, is better than Sacrifice; and to hearken, than the Fat of Rams. For rebellion is as the Sin of Witchcraft, and ſtubbornneſs is as Iniquity and Idolatry: Becauſe thou haſt rejected the word of the Lord, he hath alſo rejected thee from being King,</hi> 1 Sam. 15. 22. Obedience to the Command of God the beſt Sacrifice. Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice without Obedience is Rebellion, and Idolatry.</p>

                     <hi>his Diſciples, ſaying, The Scribes and the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees ſit in</hi> Moſes <hi>Seat: All therefore, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they bid you obſerve, that obſerve and do; but do not ye after their Works: For they ſay, and do not,</hi> Mat. 23. 1. Thoſe, who are in Authority, are to be obey'd, tho' they give not good Example.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Theſe twelve Jeſus ſent forth;—as ye go, preach, ſaying, The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.—Provide neither Gold nor Silver:—For the workman is worthy of his meat.—And whoſoever ſhall not receive you, nor hear your words: When ye depart out of that Houſe or City, ſhake off the duſt of your feet. Verily, I ſay unto you, It ſhall be more tolerable for the Land of</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrha <hi>in the Day of Judgment, than for that City,</hi> Mat. 10. 5, 9, 14. Chriſt gives Authority to teach: The Flock is to feed their Paſtors. The Obligation of hearing thoſe, whom Chriſt has put over the Flock, is from the Command of Chriſt. How ſtrict this obligation is, may be ſeen in the rigor of their puniſhment, who refuſe to hear them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He, that receiveth you, receiveth me; and he, that receiveth me, receiveth him, that ſent me,</hi> Mat. 10. 40. How great encouragement to hear thoſe, whom Chriſt has appointed to teach the Flock! To receive them, to ſubmit to them, is to receive and ſubmit to God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If he ſhall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the Church: But if he neglect to hear the</hi>

                     <hi>Church, let him be unto thee, as an Heathen Man and a Publican. Verily, I ſay unto you, Whatſoever ye ſhall bind on Earth, ſhall be bound in Heaven: And whatſoever ye ſhall looſe on Earth, ſhall be looſed in Heaven,</hi> Mat. 18. 17. See, what is the Authority of the Church in common caſes: Not to Submit to her Determination, is the Crime of a Heathen, of one, who believes not in God. And is not this Authority confirm'd while Heaven is declar'd to join with her in the Sentence ſhe pronounces? There can be no Appeal then from the Church to God: And while both concur, one cannot be queſtion'd, without arraigning the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jeſus came and ſpake unto them, ſaying, All power is given unto me in Heaven and in Earth. Go ye therefore and teach all Nations, Baptizing them—Teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded you: And lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the World.</hi> Amen. Mat. 28. 18. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Hearing thoſe, whom Chriſt has made the Paſtors of his Flock, is to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But, What need of a Command, when the Promiſe of a Divine Aſſiſtance always attending them to the end of the World, is obligation enough upon all thoſe, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be taught the Truth?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And he ſaid unto them; Go ye into all the World, and preach the Goſpel to every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. He, that believeth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved; but he, that believeth not, ſhall be</hi>

                     <hi>damned,</hi> Mar. 16. 15. Chriſt ſends to the whole World, and commands the whole World to believe thoſe, whom he ſends to teach them. What muſt their Authority and Commiſſion be, when Damnation is the Puniſhment of ſuch as refuſe to believe!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me: and he, that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me: And he, that deſpiſeth me, deſpiſeth him, that ſent me,</hi> Luk. 10. 16. What more powerful Argument could Chriſt uſe, for obliging the World to hear thoſe, whom he has ſent? In them, God is heard or deſpis'd. Paſtoral Authority (and Truth) is originally in God; it is commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to the Son, by the Miſſion of the Father; to the Apoſtles, by the Miſſion of the Son; to the following Paſtors, by their Succeſſion to the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; even the Spirit of Truth, whom the World cannot receive, becauſe it ſeeth him not, neither knoweth him,</hi> Jo. 14. 16. <hi>Howbeit, when the Spirit of Truth is come, he will guide you into all Truth,</hi> Jo. 16. 13. Great Mercy of God to the Flock, to deliver them from all Uncertainty of Truth, by appointing the Spirit of Truth to teach them in their Paſtors!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verily, verily I ſay unto you, He, that receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth whomſoever I ſend, receiveth me: And he, that receiveth me, receiveth him, that ſent me, Jo.</hi> 13. 20. They whom Chriſt ſends, are
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:34034:155"/> aſſociated in his Miſſion; being deputed by him, their Authority is his. How terrible their miſtake, in rejecting Jeſus Chriſt, when they think they reject nothing but Man! No true Miſſion, but what was given by Jeſus Chriſt to his Apoſtles, and by a Succeſſion from them, is communicated to others. If any other be pretended, it is Extraordinary, and ought to be authoriz'd by Miracle to give it Credit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then ſaid Jeſus to them again, Peace be unto you; as my Father hath ſent me, even ſo ſend I you. And when he had ſaid this, he breathed on them, and ſaith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghoſt. Whoſe ſoever Sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whoſe ſoever Sins ye retain, they are retained,</hi> Jo. 20. 21. What Authority in this Miſſion? <hi>As my Father hath ſent me, even ſo ſend I you.</hi> The Holy Ghoſt being Communicated, Man is only the Miniſter, and the Power is of God. Can ſuch Authority, ſuch Power be queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd by Man?</p>

                     <hi>Now ſend Men to</hi> Joppa, <hi>and call for one</hi> Simon, <hi>whoſe Sirname is</hi> Peter:<hi>—he ſhall tell thee, what thou oughteſt to do,</hi> Act. 10. 5. An Angel from Heaven is ſent to <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> to direct him to <hi>Peter;</hi> tho' God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires, yet the Paſtors of his Church are to teach. This is the Ordinance of Chriſt, and the Practice is confirm'd from Heaven.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And he trembling and aſtoniſhed, ſaid, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord</hi>

                     <hi>ſaid unto him, Ariſe, and go into the City, and it ſhall be told thee, what thou muſt do,</hi> Act. 9. 6. Chriſt calls upon <hi>Saul,</hi> ſtops him in his evil way; but for his Inſtruction, he ſends him to a Diſciple. If this be the Will of God, who can pretend to ſerve God, and yet make exceptions againſt doing his Will?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>When therefore</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Barnabas <hi>had no ſmall Diſſenſion and Diſputation with them, they determined, that</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Barnabas, <hi>and certain other of them, ſhould go up to</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, <hi>unto the Apoſtles and Elders, about this queſtion,</hi> Act. 15. 2. <hi>And the Apoſtles and Elders came together, for to conſider of this matter,</hi> v. 6. <hi>Then pleaſed it the Apoſtles and Elders,</hi> 22. Queſtions of Faith are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to the Paſtors of the Church. S. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> tho' great Apoſtles, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly inſpir'd, pronounce not in this caſe; but help to publiſh what the Paſtors aſſembled had determin'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And as they went thro' the Cities, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered them the Decrees for to keep, that were ordain'd of the Apostles and Elders, which were at</hi> Jeruſalem: <hi>And ſo were the Churches eſtabliſhed in the Faith, and increaſed in number daily,</hi> Act. 16. 4. The Faithful receive the Decrees of their Paſtors, and thus was the Faith eſtabliſh'd, and they perſerv'd from the dangers of Novelty and Error.</p>

                     <hi>to all the Flock, over the which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you Overſeers, to feed the Church of God, which he hath purchaſed with his own Blood,</hi> Act. 20. 28. It is the Ordinance of God, that the Flock be under the care of the Paſtors; by theſe it is to be fed, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd from Error. This Charge is given them by the Holy Ghoſt: Who dare alter the Method?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They, that ſtood by, ſaid, Revileſt thou God's High Prieſt? Then ſaid</hi> Paul, <hi>I wiſt not, Brethren, that he was the High Prieſt: For it is written; Thou ſhalt not ſpeak evil of the Ruler of thy people,</hi> Act. 23. 5. Reſpect is due from the Flock to their Paſtor; they are not to revile him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the Word of the Lord: and as many as were ordain'd to eternal Life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,</hi> Act. 13. 48. Thoſe, who are ordain'd to Salvation, hear and believe the Apoſtles. This was the way to Life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whoſoever therefore reſiſteth the Power, reſiſteth the Ordinance of God: and they that reſiſt, ſhall receive to themſelves damnation, Rom.</hi> 13. 2. Have the Paſtors of the Church Power from God?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He gave ſome, Apoſtles:—And ſome Paſtors and Teachers: For the perfecting the Saints,—for the edifying of the Body of Chriſt:—That we henceforth be no more children, toſſed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of Doctrine,</hi> Eph. 4. 11. If thus God has
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:34034:156"/> declar'd the deſign of his Goodneſs, in the Ordinance of Paſtors, then it muſt be the greateſt duty and intereſt of the Flock, to adhere to the Paſtors of the Church: For thus has God appointed, for preſerving it in Unity and Truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now I beſeech you, Brethren, by the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that ye all ſpeak the ſame thing, and that there be no diviſions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the ſame mind, and in the ſame judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 10. Thus is ſtrictly enjoin'd the Flock; then they muſt be careful in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Means, which God has ordain'd for Unity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He therefore, that deſpiſeth, deſpiſeth not Man, but God, who hath alſo given unto us his holy Spirit,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4. 8. If the Flock deſpiſe the Doctrin of thoſe, whom God has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to teach it, they deſpiſe not Man, but God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We beſeech you, Brethren, to know them, which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admoniſh you; and to eſteem them very highly in love, for their works ſake,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 12. If theſe are to be eſteem'd and lov'd; this muſt be chiefly in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and Admonitions: then no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, no ſetting up againſt them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let him, that is taught in the Word, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate unto him, that teacheth in all good things,</hi> Gal. 6. 6. <hi>Even ſo hath the Lord ordained, that they, which preach the Goſpel,</hi>

                     <hi>ſhould live of the Goſpel,</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 14. <hi>Let the Elders, that rule well, be counted worthy of double honour, eſpecially they, who labour in the Word and Doctrine: for the Scripture ſaith, Thou ſhalt not muzzle the Ox, that treadeth out the Corn: and the labourer is worthy of his reward,</hi> 1 Tim. 5. 17.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Remember them, which have the rule over you, who have ſpoken unto you the Word of God: Whoſe Faith follow, conſidering the end of their Converſation. Jeſus Chriſt the ſame yeſterday, and to day, and for ever,</hi> Heb. 13. 7. <hi>Obey them that have the rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves: For they watch for your Souls, as they that muſt give account; that they may do it with joy, and not with grief; for that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable for you,</hi> v. 17. What Charge given by God to the Flock! Remember, Submit, Obey, Follow the Faith of thoſe, who have the Rule over you; for theſe muſt g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ve ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of your Souls. But can they be any part in this account, who refuſe to obey?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He, that knoweth God, heareth us; he that is not of God, heareth not us. Hereby know we the Spirit of Truth, and the Spirit of Error,</hi> 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 4. 6. Are theſe thus diſcern'd? Then the Flock muſt here ſee the neceſſity of hearing thoſe, whom God has appointed to feed the Flock.</p>
                  <p>And now, having gone thro' the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Duties of a Chriſtian Life, as likewiſe the Particular States, in ſome of which every Chriſtian muſt have a part; and having ſeen in all theſe, what is the Will of God, as
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:34034:157"/> it is deliver'd in holy Writ; what better Concluſion can I make, than earneſtly to recommend to all, that they would fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently read, ſeriouſly conſider, and with exactneſs attend to what the Spirit of God ſays to them? It is the effect of an infinite Mercy, that God has thus left his holy Will manifeſted to us, that in this we might have a ſure Guide: And there is no other Way to Salvation, but this alone, of doing the Will of God. Thus Chriſt has declar'd; and what greater Intereſt then can a Chriſtian have, than in knowing the Will of God? This is the beſt Study; this the beſt Learning: All other, without this, are vain and uſeleſs Ornaments; but this alone, without all others, will make a Man Wiſe to Salvation. If the World ſets up for other Ways; if it has Number and Cuſtom to give Authority to them; yet all this makes them not warrantable to the Chriſtian; he muſt conſult his Rule, and whatever he finds not allow'd there, he muſt renounce, as Antichriſtian; for it is Chriſt, and not the World, is his Guide to Salvation. How perverſly blind then are all thoſe Chriſtians, who make it their Buſineſs to ſtudy the World, and eſteeming this the beſt Education, are at a great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence in training up their Children to an early Knowledge of whatever it admires? And when this is done; what is the Effect, but only to be skill'd in Vanity; to be learned in thoſe things, which lead them
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:34034:158"/> out of the Way? And in the mean time the only thing Neceſſary is neglected, and they are Strangers to that Knowledge, which can be their only Guide to that Life, for which they were born: Whereas the great Buſineſs of all that believe, is to know the Will of God, and by doing it to work out their Salvation.</p>
                  <p>If this be the Error of ſuch as are blind Lovers of themſelves and the World, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of God; then ſuch as follow the Light of Faith, muſt follow another Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: They muſt make it their general Study, to know the Will of God, they muſt ſtrictly inform themſelves, what he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, what he forbids, what he approves and diſapproves; and this being moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly deliver'd in holy Writ, they ought to eſteem the particular Knowledge of this their only ſolid Accompliſhment, and not think they have any thing valuable in them, whatever their natural or acquir'd Abilities be, as long as they are Ignorant of this. By this Method Chriſtians will ſoon be qualified for making a true Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all Things and Circumſtances of human Life; they will judge the World, and all its Ways, and not be in danger of being deluded by its Specious and moſt Authentic Snares. This is the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Wiſdom; and whoſoever takes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Way, tho' he may come to an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Degree of admir'd Knowledge, yet he will never be Wiſe to Salvation.</p>
